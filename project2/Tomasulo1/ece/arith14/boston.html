<P>
A city rich in history and culture, Boston is one of the most popular
visitor destinations in the world. Through its role as an international
center for education, high technology, finance, architecture and
medicine, Boston maintains its reputation as a world-class city.
Some of the city's noted attractions include the Boston Common, the
State House, Fenway Ballpark, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Museum of
Science, New England Aquarium, the fabled North End and Waterfront
sections, as well as numerous historical sites and museums.
However, many visitors have been known to come during the months of
October and November simply to view the area's renowned, beautiful fall 
foliage.  Boston's Logan Airport is serviced by nearly all domestic and
international airlines.
