</h1> 
Authors are invited to submit papers describing recent advances on all
aspects of computer arithmetic, including, but not restricted to the
following topics:
<ul>  
<li>        Foundations of number systems and arithmetic; 
<li>        Arithmetic processor design and implementation; 
<li>        Arithmetic algorithms and their analysis; 
<li>        Highly parallel arithmetic units and systems; 
<li>        New floating-point units and systems; 
<li>        Standards for number representation and arithmetic; 
<li>        Impact of high level languages on arithmetic systems; 
<li>        Special function implementation; and 
<li>        Applications of Computer Arithmetic for cryptography,
DSP, data compression and alike.
</ul>
<p>  

  Postscript version of the complete paper, and a separate text file with
title and abstract, should be submitted by ftp no later than:

<p>

</center> <p>
 Further instructions about submission and information about the
symposium will be posted at the web site. Submissions should conform to 
the maximum length requirement for the proceedings of the conference,
as stated below, but for reviewing should preferably be formatted in
normal article style (about 20 pages, single column, single spacing).
Authors should include an e-mail contact address, since all
correspondence will be done by e-mail.
Acceptance will be notified in December 1998, and final camera-ready
papers
(up to 8 pages, two columns) will be due in January 1999. Conference
proceedings will be available at the Symposium.
