<h2> Biography </h2>
<p>
Zahava Koren is a senior researcher at the University of Massachusetts.
She received the B.A and M.A degrees in Mathematics and Statistics
from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in 1967 and 1969, respectively,
and the D.Sc. degree in Operations Research from the
Technion - Israel Institute of Technology in 1976.
Previously she has held positions with the Department of Statistics, 
University of Haifa, Departments of Industrial Engineering and
Computer Science at the Technion, and the Department of Business and 
Economics, California State University in Los Angeles.
Her main interests are Optimization in Queuing Processes, Stochastic 
Analysis of Computer Networks and Reliability of Computer Systems.
