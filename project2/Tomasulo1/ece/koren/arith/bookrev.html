<b>Computer Arithmetic Algorithms</b>
<i>Israel Koren (Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1993, 224
pp., ISBN 0-13-15952-2, $61)</i>
<p>
In the flood of ho-hum publications on personal computers, a
contribution 
of true computing significance is rare.  But this is such a book.
Conventional numeration systems are briefly introduced in the first two 
chapters.  Next comes a discussion of simple sequential algorithms for 
multiplication and division, followed by several chapters on fast
operations for addition, multiplication and division, plus a chapter on
calculating 
elementary functions.  The especially interesting chapters on fast
operations explain pipelining, parallel and array multipliers, array 
dividers, and division by convergence  (which requires a fast parallel 
multiplier).  The book ends with a summary of logarithmic and residual 
numeration systems, which are useful in digital filtering.
<p>
There is also extensive coverage of the IEEE Std 754 on "Binary
Floating-Point Arithmetic," which had an impact on floating-point
unit design of contemporary machines. In addition to basic
floating-point representation, the book explains terms like hidden bit,
not-a-number, denormalized numbers, guard digit, and representation 
errors. In general, the material on errors is outstanding, since we 
usually forget that an actual number representing a certain quantity is
more than one value-it's a value plus an 
error indicator, usually another value defining the error.  
For comparison, several other floating-point representations are 
included, such as those by Digital and IBM.

I highly recommend this book for computer arithmetic professionals.
Its value is its summary of the most interesting aspects of arithmetic
algorithms.
