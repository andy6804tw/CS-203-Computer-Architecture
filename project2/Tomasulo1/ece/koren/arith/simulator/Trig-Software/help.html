<h1> How to Use This Software </h1>
<hr>
<h3> 1. You can input an angle in radians, and click sine, cosine or atan button to get the value and the estimation error.</h3>
<h3> 2. In this calculation, the following polynomials are used to approximate the sine and cosine functions:</h3>

<p>Above, Taylor polynomials are used at the point 0 and 2.1, respectively, to obtain a more accurate approximation.</p>
<h3> 3. Because the sine and cosine are periodic functions, the following equation is used to reduce from any input to [-3.14,3.14]: </h3>

For atan function, Remez's algorithm is used to calculate the coefficients using the following equations:</p>

<h3> 4. The following equations are used to approximate the arctangent function:</h3>

<h3> 5. The error is calculated by the following equation:</h3>
<h3>error=p(x)-Math.sin(x)/cos(x)/atan(x)</h3>
