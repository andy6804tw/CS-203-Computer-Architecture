<UL>
<LI>
The dividend X is divided by the divisor D in this program.  
These two inputs can be entered in the boxes labeled
<I>X</I> and <I>D</I> respectively.  The divisor must be a normalized
fraction in the range [0.5, 1).</LI>

<LI>
The two numbers can be given in either the <I>bin</I> (binary) or <I>dec</I> (decimal)
number system.</LI>

<LI>
Next, the total number of bits in the divider should be specified in <I>Total
Bits</I> field.  This number should be odd.</LI>

<LI>
The value of alpha must also be specified.  A larger overlap region (corresponding to a
higher value of alpha) may allow us to select comparison constants with fewer digits.  
On the other hand, a higher value of alpha means having to produce more multiples of the
form (alpha * Divisor), requiring extra hardware and/or time.

<UL>After giving all the above mentioned inputs, when you click on the
<I>Compute</I> button, in the right frame of the page, you should see
the calculations leading to the quotient, along with the P-D plot 
(partial remainder versus divisor) plot.  In this program, four different
such plots are used representing the four different choices available for alpha.

If just the alpha is selected, and the <I>Show PD Plots</I> button is pressed,
in the right frame of the page, you should see the P-D plot (partial remainder 
versus divisor) plot.  In this program, four different sets of such plots are used 
representing the four different choices available for alpha.
