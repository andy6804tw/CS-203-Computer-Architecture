This program estimates the mean and standard deviation of critical delay in 2's complement array multiplier. The multiplier design is based on the array multiplier design using true values of operands proposed in [1]. The design consists of three types of full adders:</LI>

<UL>
<LI> A standard full adder (typeI), has 3 inputs and 2 outputs- all positve in weight. </LI>

<LI> A type II adder has a bubble on one of its inputs. It also has a bubble on its outgoing sum. </LI>

<LI> A type II' adder has a bubble on two out of three of its inputs. It also has a bubble on its outgoing carry.</LI>
</UL> 


<LI>
The delay is estimated for array multiplier of bit size specified by the user for a selected technology and process variation.</LI>

<LI>
The following are the inputs to the simulator:</LI>
<UL>
<LI> The number of bits in the array multiplier: This defines the number of stages in the array and hence the length of the critical path. The default value set is 3. However, users may provide any bit width greater than 2.</LI>
<LI> Process Technology: Users may choose one of 45nm, 32nm, 22nm or 16nm process technology for estimation of delay. Default process technology is 45nm.</LI>
<LI> Sigma Vt Variation: The expected process variation for the selected technology is provided as an input. Users can specify the expected one standard deviation in transistor thresold voltage as a percentage of nominal thresold. The default 1-sigma variation is 10% of nominal threshold voltage.</LI> 
</UL>


<LI>
The delay calculation is made based on curve fitted equations derived from circuit simulation in nanometer technologies. Circuit simulations were performed using transistor models from Arizona State University's  Predictive Technolgy Models. Monte Carlo simulations were performed on all three kinds of full adders used in the array (Types I, II and II') using HSPICE across 100,000 samples to obtain distribution of adder circuits mean delay and standard deviations across various thresold voltage variations. The distributions were curve fit using MATLAB to obtain 2nd order polynomial equations for mean delay and standard deviations (1-sigma) as a function of sigma variation in transistor threshold voltage.</LI>

<LI> Depending on the process technology selected, the 1-sigma threshold variation specified is used as input to appropriate equations to estimate the mean and standard deviation of each type of adder. Based on the size of operands, the overall mean delay and standard deviation of the array multiplier is estimated by adding the mean of appropriate number of Type I, Type II and Type II' adders in the most critcal path of the array. We assume adders in each stage to have independent variation. Similarly the standard deviation is estimated as a root mean square of the standard deviations of the different adders in the critical path.   </LI>
