<h2>About This Site</h2>
</font></big></center>
<br>
This site was designed and programmed to serve as a helpful aid to
students taking a class in computer arithmetic, or practitioners
in the field  who need to brush up on the techniques used by the 
various algorithms.<p>
The initial programming and layout was done by <B>Yaron Koren</B>
in the summer of 1997.
