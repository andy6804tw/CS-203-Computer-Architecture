<LI>
Two numbers are divided in this program. The two numbers can be given in
the boxes named as <I>X</I> and <I>D</I>.</LI> The divisor must be a 
normalized fraction in the range [0.5, 1).  
<LI>
Numbers can be given in either <I>bin</I> (binary) or <I>dec</I> 
(decimal) number system.</LI>

<LI>
Next, the total number of bits in the adder should be specified in <I>Total
Bits</I> field.</LI>

<LI>
Next, the type of divider should be chosen.
There are 6 different types of dividers available in this
simulation. Each divider consists of smaller dividers, either
SRT2 or SRT4. When using the SRT4 divider as a component of 
a larger divider, the value of alpha is set to 3.
<LI>
Below is a list of the dividers:
<UL>
<LI>
SRT4 using 2 SRT2 dividers. Each iteration of this divider will compute 2
quotient bits. In the first divider, 1 remainder will be calculated and
in the second divider 3 remainders will be calculated. <br>

<LI>
SRT8 using 3 SRT2 dividers. Each iteration of this divider will compute 3
quotient bits. In the first divider, 1 remainder will be calculated, 3
remainders will be calculated in the second stage, and 15 remainders
will be calculated in the third stage. <br>

<LI>
SRT16 using 4 SRT2 dividers. Each iteration of this divider will compute 4
quotient bits.  <br>

<LI>
SRT8 using a SRT2 divider followed by a SRT4 divider. Each iteration of this
divider will compute 3 quotient bits. <br>

<LI>
SRT8 using a SRT4 divider followed by a SRT2 divider. Each iteration of this
divider will compute 3 quotient bits. <br>

<LI>
SRT16 using 2 SRT4 dividers. Each iteration of this divider will computer 4
quotient and 4 remainder bits. <br>

</UL>

<LI>
After that, you have to specify a few delays in the <I>Signal Delays</I>
section. Those delays are:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Delay of CSA 
<LI>
Delay of Radix-2 Qsel Unit
<LI>
Delay of Radix-4 Qsel Unit
<LI>
Delay of 2 input Mux
<LI>
Delay of 7 input Mux
<LI>
Delay of 15 input Mux

</UL>
</UL>

<UL>After giving all the above mentioned inputs, when you click on the
<I>Compute</I> button, in the right frame of the page, you can see all
the calculations leading to the output. All the partial remainders 
are shown and the remainders that are used in generating the result are
in <font color=red>RED</font>.
After each remainder, the quotient generated by that remainder 
and the operation used to generate the next remainder are shown.
<LI> 

<P>At the bottom, the time taken to generate the final quotient bit in 
each iteration and the total amount of time to generate the 
final quotient are shown. The critital path is also described.</UL>
