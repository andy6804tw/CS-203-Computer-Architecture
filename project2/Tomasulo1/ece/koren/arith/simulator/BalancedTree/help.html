<br><b>Input Format:</b>
The input are Integers either in binary format or decimal. The
inputs need not be contiguous. The simulator counts the inputs and
correspondingly builds the Balanced Tree.
<br>
<br>
<b>Comparison with Wallace Trees and Overturned-Stairs Tress:</b>
<br>The wiring tracks which will affect the layout area are differ in these three tree
structures. The Wallace tree has the largest number of wiring tracks (on the order of logN,
where N is the number of inputs), then overturned-stairs and then balanced tree. However,
the Wallace tress are theoretically fastest adders among these three tree structures. On the
other hand, the balaced tree has the smallest number of wiring tracks but with the highest
overall delay.
<br>
<br><b>Delay Calculation:</b>
<br><font >In this simulation, the minimum delay of the final output
is calculated. Looking at the schematic diagram below:</font>
<p><img SRC="help.gif" height=250 width=350>
<p><font >in 3-2 adder Carry delay is smaller than Sum delay. In
this design we assumed that Sum delay is smaller than twice of carry delay
as well.</font>
<p><font>Assuming:</font>
<blockquote><font size=+1>Ta: arrival time of input "a"</font>
<br><font >Tb: arrival time of input "b"</font>
<br><font >Tcin: arrival time of input "Cin"</font>
<br><font >Tsum: time that Sum will be ready, considering arrival
time of inputs</font>
<br><font >Tcout: time that Carry out will be ready, considering
arrival time of inputs</font></blockquote>
<font ></font>
<p><br><font >&nbsp;final output delays will be calculated as follow:</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font >Tsum =&nbsp; Max{&nbsp; ( Max(Ta,Tb) + Sum Delay )&nbsp;
,&nbsp; (&nbsp; Tcin +&nbsp; Sum Delay/2 )&nbsp; }</font>
<br><font >Tcout = [ Max (Ta, Tb,Tcin) ] + Carry Delay</font>
