<center><b><u><font size=+2>How to Run</font></u></b></center>
</dl>

<ul>
<li>
Two numbers are added in this program. The two numbers can be given in
the boxes named as <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.</li>

<li>
Two numbers can be given in either <i>bin</i> (binary) or <i>dec</i> (decimal)
number system.</li>

<li>
Next, the total number of bits in the adder should be specified in <i>Total
Bits</i> field.</li>

<li>
In this adder, the total number of bits are divided into a number of blocks.
So the user can specify the number of bits in each block in this field.
eg. block sizes of 1, 2, 3, 4 bits should be specified as 1 2 3 4. Remember
to leave spaces between the numbers and also check that the sum of these
block sizes&nbsp; should be equal to the total number of bits specified.&nbsp;
Also after the end of the last block size there should not be any space.</li>

<li>
After that, you have to specify a few delays in the <i>Signal Delays</i>
section.</li>

<ul>
<li>
A<sub>i</sub> to C<sub>i+1</sub> : This is the delay from one of the inputs to the carry out generated.
</li>

<li>
C<sub>i</sub> to C<sub>i+1</sub> : This is the delay from the input carry to the carry out generated. 
</li>

<li>
C<sub>i</sub> to S<sub>i</sub> : This is the delay from the input carry to the output sum generated.
</li>


<li>
A<sub>i</sub> to S<sub>i</sub> : This is the delay from one of the inputs to the output sum generated.
</li>
<br>
<i>The above delays are the same as the delays in the Ripple carry adder.</i>

<li>
Mux Delay : Specify the delay of&nbsp; 2 -> 1 mux.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<center><b><u><font size=+2>Format of Output</font></u></b></center>

<ul>After giving all the above mentioned inputs, when you click on the
<i>Compute</i>
button, in the right frame of the page, you can see a diagram of the carry
skip adder circuit and the timing data.
<ul>
<li>
In the diagram the top block is an array of one bit Full adders. The total number of adders is equal to the number of bits in the block and also they are divided into the block size specified. The most important thing is that they carry out addition assuming that the input carry to each block is 0. The output generated is shown in the boxes below them.
</li>

<li>
Next there is a second array of one bit full adders which are similar to the one above with one difference : The addition is done assuming that the incoming carry to each block is 1. The ouput generated is shown in the boxes below them.
</li>

<li>
The ouput of the adders is fed to a multiplexer which takes the input and depending on the incoming carry generates the ouput sum and the input carry for the next block.
</li>

<li>
At the bottom, we show the time taken for various operations in a delay
table format. The SumDelay for the block is the delay taken by the adder array any of the above blocks, since this operation is done is parallel the result is available at the same time. The carry in shows at what time the true carry available to the block and the final sum shows the time at which the final result is available from the the block.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
