<center><b><u><font size=+2>How to Run</font></u></b></center>
</dl>

<ul>
<li>
Two numbers are added in this program. The two numbers can be given in
the boxes named as <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.</li>

<li>
Two numbers can be given in either <i>bin</i> (binary) or <i>dec</i> (decimal)
number system.</li>

<li>
Next, the total number of bits in the adder should be specified in <i>Total
Bits</i> field.</li>

<li>
In this adder, the total number of bits are divided into a number of smaller equal/unequal adder blocks.
The number of adder blocks is specified in <i>Individual Adder Size</i> field.
The sum of the bits entered in the <i>Individual Adder Size</i> field should be equal to the
<i>Total Bits</i> entered. The adder blocks when entered should have exactly one space between them. No extra space should be 
entered in the beginning or at the end. 
</li>

<li>The basic adder can be of two types. One is Ripple Carry and the other is
Manchester Carry. The user has to select the adder type from <i>Basic Adder Type</i> field.
The delays are computed based on the adder type chosen.

<li>The conditional sum adder structure can be of two types. One is Assymetric where the most significant adder blocks are combined one at a time. The other structure is a Symmetric structure where two adder blocks are combined at a time irrespective of their sizes. This combining goes on till a single block of size equal to the total number of bits is obtained. The adder structure to be simulated is entered in <i>Adder Structure</i> field.  

<li>
The user has to specify a few delays in the <i>Signal Delays</i>
section.</li>

<ul>
<li>
A<sub>i</sub> to C<sub>i+1</sub> : This is the delay from one of the inputs to the carry out generated.
</li>

<li>
C<sub>i</sub> to C<sub>i+1</sub> : This is the delay from the input carry to the carry out generated. 
</li>

<li>
C<sub>i</sub> to S<sub>i</sub> : This is the delay from the input carry to the output sum generated.
</li>


<li>
A<sub>i</sub> to S<sub>i</sub> : This is the delay from one of the inputs to the output sum generated.
</li>

<li>Mux Delay : Specify the delay of&nbsp; 2 -> 1 mux.</li>
<li>Switch Delay : Specify the delay of a pass-transistor switch used in Manchester Carry</li>
<li>Basic Gate Delay : Specify the delay of a basic gate (OR, AND or NOT).</li>
<li>Ex-OR Gate Delay : Specify the delay of an Ex-OR gate.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<center><b><u><font size=+2>Format of Output</font></u></b></center>
<BR>
After giving all the above mentioned inputs, when you click on the
<i>Compute</i>
button, in the right frame of the page, you can see a diagram of the Generalized Conditional Sum circuit and the timing data.
<ul>
<li>
The first part of the output is the block diagram of the adder. The block diagram is displayed only if an Assymetric adder structure is chosen with equal adder sizes. Depending on the number of adder blocks and the type of adder chosen, the first level of the adder is displayed. Then starting from the most significant block, the adder blocks are combined one by one using multiplexers. All the combining stages have two multiplexers, choosing an adder block  based on the carry out generated by the previous adder block. The final stage has only one multiplexer as the actual value of the carry is known.
</li>

<li>
Then the 2's complement representation of both the inputs A and B is displayed along with the decimal value.
The actual sum value obtained is also displayed below the inputs.
</li>

<li>
At the bottom, the delay in calculating the sum and carry outputs is diaplayed in a table format. In the first row of the table, the delay of the first adder block is diaplayed. The delay of the top level adder block depends on the type and the size of the adder chosen. The second row displays the delay of the multiplexer chain. The total delay of the adder and the multiplexer levels is displayed in the last row.
</li>

<li>
By choosing the adder type and the size accordingly, various adder configurations can be simulated. By setting the number of adder bits and the first level adder block size the same, a conventional ripple carry or a manchester carry adder can be simulated. By setting the basic adder size to one, a binary conditional sum adder can be simulated. Various adder configurations can be tried using this simulator.
