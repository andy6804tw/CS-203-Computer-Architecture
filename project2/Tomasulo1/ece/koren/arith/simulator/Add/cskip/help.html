</dl>

<ul>
<li>
This program adds two numbers. The numbers are to be provided by the user in
the boxes named as <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.</li>

<li>
The numbers can be given in either <i>bin</i> (binary) or <i>dec</i> (decimal)
number system. Make sure you have selected the right radio button!</li>

<li>
The total number of bits in the adder should be specified in <i>Total
Bits</i> field.</li>

<li>
In the carry skip adder, the total number of bits are divided into a number of blocks.
So the user can specify the number of bits in each block in this field.
eg. block sizes of 1, 2, 3, 4 bits should be specified as 1 2 3 4. Remember
to leave spaces between the numbers and also check that the sum of these
block sizes&nbsp; should be equal to the total number of bits specified.&nbsp;
Also after the end of the last block size there should not be any space.</li>

<li>
After that, you have to specify a few delays in the <i>Signal Delays</i>
section.</li>

<ul>
<li>
A<sub>i</sub> to C<sub>i+1</sub> : This is the delay from one of the inputs to the carry out generated.
</li>

<li>
C<sub>i</sub> to C<sub>i+1</sub> : This is the delay from the input carry to the carry out generated. 
</li>

<li>
C<sub>i</sub> to S<sub>i</sub> : This is the delay from the input carry to the output sum generated.
</li>


<li>
A<sub>i</sub> to S<sub>i</sub> : This is the delay from one of the inputs to the output sum generated.
</li>
<br>
<i>The above delays are the same as the delays in the Ripple carry adder.</i>

<li>
Buffer Delay : Specify the delay of&nbsp; buffer which acts as an OR gate</li>

<li>
Skip Delay : Specify the time taken by the carry signal to skip over the entire group and reach the next group </li>
</ul>
</ul>

<center><b><u><font size=+2>Format of Output</font></u></b></center>

<ul>After giving all the above mentioned inputs, when you click on the
<i>Compute</i>
button, in the right frame of the page, you can see a diagram of the carry
skip adder circuit and the timing data.
<ul>
<li>
In the diagram the top block is an array of one bit Full adders. The total number of adders is equal to the number of bits in the block and also they are divided into block sizes as specified by the user. 
</li>

<li>
At the bottom, we show the timings of the various signals in the adder.
The SumDelay for the block is the delay taken by the adder array any of the above blocks, since this operation is done is parallel the result is available at the same time. The carry in shows at what time the true carry available to the block and the final sum shows the time at which the final result is available from the the block.
</li>
</ul>
