<LI>
This program adds the two numbers specified in the boxes <I>A</I> and <I>B</I>.</LI>

<LI>
Two numbers can be given in either the binary <I>(bin)</I> or decimal <I>(dec)</I> 
number system.</LI>

<LI>
The total number of bits in the adder should be specified in the <I>Total
Bits</I> field.</LI>

<LI>
The total number of bits are divided into groups of the size specified in the 
<I>Group Size</I> field.</LI>

<LI>
Delay calculations are made based upon the values entered in the <I>Signal Delays</I>
section.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Delay of an AND/OR gate</LI>

<LI>
Delay of an XOR gate</LI>

<LI>
Maximum Fan-In</LI>
<BR>
<BR>
</UL>
The delay is calculated as follows:
<UL>
<LI>The time taken to calculate t<SUB>i</SUB> and g<SUB>i</SUB> for each bit is 
equal to the dealy of an OR gate.</LI>
<LI> The second stage delay is calculated by the number of levels of AND gates plus 
the number of levels of OR gates (as determined by the fan-in value), all multiplied by
the delay for an AND/OR gate.  For a very large fan-in value, there is one level of 
AND gates and one level of OR gates, so the delay for the second stage in this case 
would be (2 * AND/OR gate delay).</LI>
<LI>The third stage delay is calculated similarly to the second stage.  Note that a 
"ripple-carry" method is used for carries on the last stage.  Because of this, the delay
for more significant bits is greater than the delay for the least significant bits.</LI>
<LI>Finally, the delay for calculating the sum is added.  For a Ling adder, each sum
bit is calculated by the following equation:<BR>
<CENTER>s<SUB>i</SUB> = t<SUB>i</SUB> XOR H<SUB>i</SUB>+g<SUB>i</SUB>t<SUB>i-1</SUB>H<SUB>i-1</SUB></CENTER><BR>
Since all the values are available by the time the sum bit needs to be calculated, the
associated delay is the delay of an OR gate plus the delay of an XOR gate.</LI>

<UL>After entering the required values in the form, click the
<I>Compute</I> button. This will display a diagram of the Ling adder in the right frame.
Timing data will also be displayed.
<UL>
<LI>
The top row of the diagram consists of adders represented by the following symbol:<BR>

<BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="linggif/plusbox.gif" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=47></CENTER><BR>

These adders calculate the individual sum bits (represented
by the short arrow) based upon the two inputs and a carry-in.  This cell also generates
<I>Generate</I> and <I>Propagate</I> signals, respectively.  Generate is the long arrow on
the left of the cell, and Propagate is the long arrow in the middle.  The Propagate signal
for the Ling adder differs slightly from that of the conventional carry look-ahead adder.
Instead of a logical XOR of the input bits, the Propagate signal (t<SUB>i</SUB>) is the 
OR of the inputs.  The Propagate and Generate signals are functions of only the two 
input bits.</LI>
<BR>


<LI>
Two levels of "Ling" carry-look-ahead generators are used.  The arrows under each block
represent H<SUB>i:j</SUB>* and P<SUB>i:j</SUB>* that are being generated from that block.</LI>

</UL>


<P>The time taken to generate each sum bit is displayed on the bottom, as well as the total 
time.  For comparison, the time required for a tradional carry look-ahead is also calculated.  
The advantage of the Ling implementation is largely dependent on the block size and maximum
fan-in.  The Ling implementation uses considerably fewer signals and gates, but this does not
necessarily translate into faster addition time.</UL>
