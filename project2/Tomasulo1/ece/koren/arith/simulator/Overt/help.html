<br><b>Input Format:</b>
The input are Integers either in binary format or decimal. The
inputs need not be contiguous. The simulator counts the inputs and
correspondingly builds the OS Tree.
<br>
<b>Overturned-Stairs Trees(OS Trees):</b>
<br>Multioperand adders are widely needed for designing multipliers, digital filters, and  
inner-product computers.Overturned-Stairs Trees (OS Trees) acheive an squareroot(N) summing
time.Where N is number of operands. An important feature of OS Trees is their recursive
structure, which leads to a regular and compact design.

<br>
A OS tree of height J consists of I) a body of height J-1 II) a branch of height J-2 III) Connector
A branch of height J-2 consists of J-2 CSA's cascaded vertically. A connector is composed of 
two CSA's which receive five inputs and give three outputs. 
<br>
<br> 
<b>Comparison With Wallace Trees:</b>
<br>
Wallace trees are theoretically fastest Multioperand adders.  When adding multiple operands to
two numbers  using carry save adders(CSA), They achieve the lower bound on the summing time
required  by an N-to-2 reduction, O(log<sub>3/2</sub>N).However, Wallace Trees are very difficult to 
implement because of their complex wiring.       
<br>
<br> 
 N= 24, 18, 17, 13, 12, 11, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2
<br>However for the above values of N OS trees matches with wallace tree.

<br><b>Delay Calculation:</b>
<br><font >In this simulation, the minimum delay of the final output
is calculated. Looking at the schematic diagram below:</font>
<p><img SRC="help.gif" height=280 width=359>
<p><font >in 3-2 adder Carry delay is smaller than Sum delay. In
this design we assumed that Sum delay is smaller than twice of carry delay
as well.</font>
<p><font>Assuming:</font>
<blockquote><font size=+1>Ta: arrival time of input "a"</font>
<br><font >Tb: arrival time of input "b"</font>
<br><font >Tcin: arrival time of input "Cin"</font>
<br><font >Ts: time that Sum will be ready, considering arrival
time of inputs</font>
<br><font >Tcout: time that Carry out will be ready, considering
arrival time of inputs</font></blockquote>
<font ></font>
<p><br><font >&nbsp;final output delays will be calculated as follow:</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font >Ts =&nbsp; Max{&nbsp; ( Max(Ta,Tb) + Sum Delay )&nbsp;
,&nbsp; (&nbsp; Tcin +&nbsp; Sum Delay/2 )&nbsp; }</font>
<br><font >Tcout = [ Max (Ta, Tb,Tcin) ] + Carry Delay</font>
