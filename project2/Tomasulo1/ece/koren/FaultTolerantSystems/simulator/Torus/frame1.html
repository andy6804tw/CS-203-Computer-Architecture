  <b><font size="4">Terminal Reliability and Performance estimation of Torus Networks 
  in presence of faults</font></b><br><br>
  
  This project determines the terminal reliability of Torus Networks through simulation. 
  Performance degradation in presence of faults is also evaluated in terms of 
  increase in average distance of the network. Average distance of network is defined as the average shortest path length from a node to any
  other nodes of the network.<br> 
  More information on Torus networks and their characteristics can be found at 
  <a href="paper.pdf">Cost-Performance Trade-offs in Manhattan
Street Network Versus 2-D Torus</a>. The paper is a part of IEEE Transactions on computers, vol. 43, no. 2, February 1994<p>
