<u><b>Following are the instructions to operate the simulator.</b></u><p>1. Enter N- 
Number of nodes in a row: The Torus Network will have total nodes as N * N. The 
value of N should be less than or equal to 10. </p>
<p>2. Enter R-Reliability of each node: Each of the nodes constituting the Torus 
network will have failure probability as 1-R. The value of R should be less than 
1.0 </p>
<p>3. Click Draw: A Torus network is drawn with specified number of nodes. Nodes 
are numbered from left to right and top to bottom.</p>
<p>4. Enter Source/Destination: In order to calculate terminal 
reliability, a source and destination pair needs to specified. Source and 
destination can be chosen from any or the nodes in the Torus network that is 
drawn. Nodes are identified by the numbers that appear against them. </p>
<p>6. Select Links: The links that connect any two nodes in the network can be 
Unidirectional or Bidirectional. The links are assumed to be fault-free. </p>
<p>7. Start Simulation: Once all the parameters are entered, simulation can be 
started. To do this two different options are available:<ol type="a">
  <li>Complete Run: On pressing this button, the simulation will run to its end. 
  The total number of iterations executed is determined by the position of 
  slider. For all simulations, a default value of 500000 is set<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Step : On pressing 'Step' the simulation will execute the first 5000 
  iterations. To execute next set of iterations, press &quot;Step&quot; again. This can be 
  executed till simulation runs to completion. At any time of simulation run, 
  stop can be pressed. This will exit the simulation and calculate the terminal reliability 
also indicating the number of iterations in 'Current Iteration' that have been 
used to determine the terminal reliability.
  </li>
  </ol><p>
<i>On the simulation run, following colors denote the node characteristics:</i><ul>
  <li><i>RED: A red node denotes a faulty node.</i></li>
  <li><i>BLACK: All nodes that remain black, are up or fault-free</i></li>
  <li><i>GREEN: A path between a source and destination pair is illustrated with 
  all nodes and links in path as green. This obviously means that all green 
  nodes are also fault free.</i></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
<i>In a certain simulation if no green nodes/links appear, this symbolizes 
absence of path from source to destination. One such scenario is when the source 
or the destination itself is faulty.</i><p>&nbsp;8. Performance: After completion, the impact of performance can be 
viewed by clicking 'Performance'. This shows the average distance in presence of 
faults. </p>
<p>9. Clear: Click 'Clear' to clear all fields and enter new values for another 
simulation. </p>
