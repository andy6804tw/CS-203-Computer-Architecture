Concurrent Error Detection in ALU's by Recomputing.</h1></center>

<p><br>
<p><font size=+4>C</font>oncurrent Error detection is a very important
issue in fault tolerant VLSI systems. If there is no this kind of error
protection, a one-bit error can be propagated thorough the whole system
and it will cause many other errors. By using concurrent error detection
scheme, system can detect errors and can do the normal operation at the
same time.
<p><font size=+4>P</font>eople usually using hardware redundancy or time
redundancy to detect errors. Hardware redundancy means a kind of duplex
system. In this kind of system, the outputs of duplicated hardware are
compared. Another redundancy scheme is time redundancy.&nbsp; This will
redo the operation, such as bit-wise, bit-wise and or add, in a different
way to allow errors to be detected. During the first computation, the normal
operands will be applied. In the re-computation step the operands are encoded
and correct results can be generated after decoding. RERO and RESO are
one of those systems.
<p><font size=+4>R</font>ESO-k (Re-computing with Shifted Operands by k-bit)[1]
is most famous time redundancy method. In this method, all arithmetic and
logical operations are done twice, once with normal operands, and once
with the operands shifted by k bits. This method can detect k consecutive
logic errors and (k-1) arithmetic errors.
<p><font size=+4>R</font>ERO-k (Re-computing with Rotated Operands by k-bit)[2]
is another method. In this method,&nbsp; scheme is very similar to&nbsp;
RESO-k, but rotated operands are used instead of shifted operands. This
method can detect (k mod n) consecutive errors in logical operations and
(k mod (n+1)-1) consecutive errors in arithmetic operations.
