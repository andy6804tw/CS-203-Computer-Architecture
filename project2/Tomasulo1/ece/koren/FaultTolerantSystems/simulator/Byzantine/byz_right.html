<hr WIDTH="100%"></center>
<font size=+1>This application is intended to&nbsp; demonstrate the Byzantine
Generals Problem and the various Byzantine Agreement Algorithms.</font>
<p><b><i><font color="#000099">Problem Description:</font></i>The Byzantine
Generals Problem is an abstraction of the problem of reaching an agreement
in a system where components can fail in an arbitrary manner. In such a
case, the component can behave arbitrarily and can send different messages
to different components.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The abstraction of the problem deals with the
idea of generals of the Byzantine Army communicating with each other. The
generals must reach a consensus among themselves whether to attack or retreat
based on the messages exchanged. The problem is complicated by the fact
that some of the generals can be traitors who may send conflicting messages
to the other generals. The solution to the problem must allow all the loyal
generals to agree upon a common plan of action. Also, if the commanding
general is loyal then all the loyal generals must obey the order he sends.</b>
<p><b><i><font color="#000099">Problem Solution:</font></i>The application
implements two Byzantine Agreement Protocols : Oral Message Algorithm and
Signed Message Algorithm.</b>
<p><b><i><font color="#000099">Solution with Oral Messages:</font></i>&nbsp;
This algorithm works only when the number of generals 'N'&nbsp; is atleast
3M+1 where 'M' is the number of faulty nodes (traitors). The algorithm
works in rounds where in each round messages are exchanged between the
generals. In Round 1, the commander sends a command to N-1 other generals.
In the next round, each receiver communicates the value he receives from
the commander to the other N-2 generals and so on. Eventually when all
rounds are completed each loyal general takes the majority of the messages
that he has recieved and uses that as the value.</b>
<p><b><font color="#000099"><i>Solution with Signed Messages</i>:</font>
In this algorithm, each general can send only unforgeable signed messages.
This will prevent a traitor general from sending a value other than what
he receives. This algorithm can handle 'M' traitors with any number of
generals. Also, since only unforgeable signed messages are sent the number
of messages exchanged is smaller.</b>
<p><b><i><font color="#000099">Example of 4 Generals with 1 traitor:</font></i>
This is to demonstrate the Oral Message Algorithm with 4 generals in the
presence of a single traitor. Here, the messages exchanged are also displayed
graphically.</b>
<p><b><i><font color="#000099">About the Application:</font></i><font color="#000000">
This application has been developed as a part of the course requirement
for ECE655(Fault Tolerant Computing),Spring 2001,ECE Dept, UMass, Amherst.
The application has been developed using Java. The algorithms are implemented
as Java Applets. For help on using the application refer to the Help page.</font></b>
<p><b><i><font color="#000099">System Requirements: </font></i><font color="#000000">The
application makes use of Java Swing Applets which requires that the web
browser supports Java PlugIn. The JavaPlugIn is available with <a href="../../../../../../java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/default.htm">JRE1.3.1</a>
and also <a href="../../../../../../java.sun.com/products/plugin/index-1.html">here.</a></font></b>
