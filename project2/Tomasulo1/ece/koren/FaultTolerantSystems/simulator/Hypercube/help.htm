<title>Using Hypercube Simulator</title>

<p><font size="7">Using Hypercube Simulator:</font> </p>
<p>The Hypercube Simulator tool calculates three things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The probability that the given hypercube is connected:&nbsp; This means 
  that each node in the hypercube is connected to every other node in the 
  hypercube by at least one path. This is the least restrictive definition of a 
  connected hypercube and uses a fully fault tolerant routing algorithm in order 
  to test node to node connections.</li>
  <li>The probability that each lower order fully connected subcube is connected 
  within the given hypercube:&nbsp; A fully connected subcube of order N is 
  defined as 2^N connected nodes each with N working links.&nbsp; This is the 
  most restrictive definition of a subcube, but it represents the most useful 
  configuration.&nbsp; Such a subcube would have most of the properties of an 
  uninjured hypercube of dimension N.&nbsp; This could run all algorithms 
  designed for N dimension hypercubes.</li>
  <li>The probability that each lower order sparsely connected subcube is 
  connected within the given hypercube:&nbsp; A sparsely connected subcube of 
  order N is defined as 2^N connected nodes each with as little as one working 
  link.&nbsp; This is the least restrictive definition of a subcube, but it 
  illustrates the fault tolerant nature of a hypercube network.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>The calculated values are output in the text area beneath the Run Simulation 
button.&nbsp; The probabilities of each type of subcube are also represented in 
the two bar graphs located beneath the output text area.&nbsp; Be sure to pay 
attention to the scale and boundary values of the bar graphs as they can change 
each time the simulation is run.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The link reliability is the average probability that a given link is working.&nbsp; 
It can be changed to any decimal value between 0 and 1.0.&nbsp; The hypercube 
dimension is the dimension of the hypercube to be simulated and can be changed 
to any value between 3 and 30.&nbsp; However, it should be kept in mind that the 
simulation time will increase exponentially with the hypercube dimension, 
therefore, any simulation of a hypercube of dimension greater than 10 should be 
expected to take several minutes, with extremely large cubes taking hours.&nbsp; 
The number of iterations is the number of randomly configured hypercubes which 
will be tested in order to calculate the probabilities.&nbsp; Keep in mind that 
the more iterations used to more accurate the values will be, and the longer the 
simulation will take.&nbsp; Be sure to choose a value accordingly.&nbsp; Also, 
note that if the value does not change more than .1% in 500 iterations the 
simulation will stop, having reached a stable value, and the total number of 
completed iterations will be displayed in the output text area.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
progress bar is also located directly beneath the simulation button in order to 
track simulation performance and progress.</p>
