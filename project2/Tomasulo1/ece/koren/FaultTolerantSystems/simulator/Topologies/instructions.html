 <h2> Instructions to use the simulator</h2>
 
1. The number of nodes for reliability calculation needs to be a power of 2. This is because hypercube networks requires number of nodes to be in powers of 2 and doing so will help in comparing the 3 networks. 
<br>
2. This simulator supports a maximum number of 16 nodes.
 <br>
3. For the routing path generation, the source and destination needs to be provided in <b>binary format</b>. The output is the total number of links traversed to get    the shortest path from source to destination.
 <br>
4. The analysis provided for the reliability is based on the reliability results generated. These are the results calculated from the nodes and link probabilities provided as input. The reliability accuracy is given up to 6th decimal place.
 <br>


<h2> Understanding how the Simulator works</h2>
1. The computed network reliability indicates that any one node in the network is able to communicate with every other nodes through atleast one path.
 <ul>
 <li> For the Torus network, this calculation is based on the assumption that the network is an N*N network.
 <li> The reliability of the Chordal network is as described in the paper "Survival Reliability of Some Double-Loop Networks and Chordal Rings" by Frank K Hwang and       Paul E. Wright; wherein they calculate the reliability(of the chordal represented as a double loop) based on the reliability equation for double loop networks.
 <li> The reliability of the hypercube network is calculated as a lower bound that performs recursive calculation to obtain the reliability for the given number of        nodes( number of nodes must be a power of 2).
 <br>
 </ul>
 2. The routing algorithm provides the smallest number of links that need to be traversed to go from source to destination. This value helps compare networks based on    traffic in the network. For example, having the knowledge that a source node and destination node communicate frequently, it would be beneficial to have a network    that provides the shortest path between those 2 nodes.
