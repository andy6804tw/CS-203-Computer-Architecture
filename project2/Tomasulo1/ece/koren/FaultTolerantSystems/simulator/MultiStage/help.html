<H3><CENTER>Help for Connectivity and Bandwidth Calculation for Butterfly Networks</CENTER></H3>
<P>
This JAVA program calculates the connectivity and bandwidth measures for a multi-stage
or an extra-stage butterfly network given the failure probabilities of the processors,
memories and links, and the probability that each processor generates a request
during each cycle. <BR>
To use the program, just input resonable parameters (for number of stages, processor
failure probability, memory failure probability, link failure probability and
processor request probability) and click "Refresh". The program shows the results
within the corresponding textfields. The program also draws sketchs for butterfly
networks up to 5 stages. <BR>
<B>Hints for inputs and outputs:</B><BR>
Number of stages (2-20): an extra-stage butterfly network has an extra stage besides
these normal stages.<BR>
Processor failure probability (0-1): the probability that a processor is faulty.<BR>
Memory failure probability (0-1): the probability that a memory is faulty.<BR>
Link failure probability (0-1): the probability that a link is faulty.<BR>
Processor request probability (0-1): the probability that each processor generates a
request during each cycle.<BR>
The expected number of operational processor-to-memory paths: a path includes a
processor, a memory, and the links connecting them.<BR>
Accessible: A processor/memory is accessible if it is fault-free and is connected
to at least one fault-free memory/processor.<BR>
Bandwidth: the expected number of requests for the shared memory which are accepted
per cycle.
