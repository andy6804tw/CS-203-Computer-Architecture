One of the ways system designers can improve on the overall reliability of a system is to implement hardware redundancy. Hardware
redundancy involves using multiple copies of the same hardware.  However, hardware redundancy tends to have higher
costs and larger circuitry needs.  Only the most critical applications, such as space exploration and airplane flights, 
are hardware redundancies considered into the design.  This calculator tool examines 2 variations of hardware redundancy.

<font size = "4">NMR with Voter:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 1st variation is called N-modular Redundancy with a voter scheme (or better known as M-of-N system).  In this 
configuration, all the independent modules perform the same task in parallel, and then use a voting scheme to determine
the correct output.  We will assume a basic majority voting scheme where "M" is the minimum number of modules required
to get a majority count out of "N" modules.  So, this can tolerate at most N - M modules to fail.

<font size = "4">NMR with Spares:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 2nd variation used in this tool is a N-modular redundant scheme where only 1 module is actively processing while the
other (spare) modules are waiting for the active module to fail.  This tool considers 2 conditions that the spare modules
can be in - either they are always powered on ("active") or they are on stand-by in which they are active only when the processing module fails.  
In the "active" spares configuration, a fault detection & reconfiguration unit determines when the active processing unit fails and then
switches to one of the other spares which are already powered-on.  Since all the spare modules are powered-on from the beginning, they tend
to have all the same failures rates and the system reliability becomes similar to a basic parallel system.  In the "standby" spares
configuration, the spares are not powered-on in order to conserve energy.  The system reliability calculation takes into account the coverage factor "C",
which is the probability that the faulty active module will be correctly diagnosed and disconnected and a good spare will be activated and replace
the faulty module.  In this calculator tool, we also take into account the reliability of the fault detector & reconfiguration unit for both active & 
standby spares cases.
