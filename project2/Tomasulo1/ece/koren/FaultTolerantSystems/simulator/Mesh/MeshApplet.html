<hr width="100%">Estimating Reliability of Interstitial Mesh Networks.<br>
     </h3>
     This project determines the reliability of Interstitial Mesh Networks
 through  simulation. The simulation procedure implemented is described in
 the paper  <br>
      Interstitial Redundancy: An Area Efficient Fault Tolerance Scheme for 
 Large Area VLSI processor Arrays by Adit D. Singh.&nbsp; The paper is a part
 of IEEE Transactions on Computers, Vol. 37, No. 11, November 1988.<br>
