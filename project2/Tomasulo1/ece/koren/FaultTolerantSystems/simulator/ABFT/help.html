<b><u>ABFT Overview</u></b><br>
<p>
This application is an implementation of Algorithm Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT) illustrated 
through add and multiply matrix operations.  This technique consists of adding checksum
information to both operands prior to the matrix operation.  After the matrix operation is 
complete, the computed matrix will contain similar checksum information.  The integrity of 
the computed matrix can then be checked for errors based on this checksum information.
<p>
The checksum information is added to each matrix operand by computing and storing the checksums 
across each row and down each column.  This increases the size of each matrix by 1.  Once
the matrix operation has been performed, the checksums of the resulting matrix can be computed
and compared against the checksums obtained through the matrix operation.  If these checksums 
do not match, then an error has been detected.
<p>
This method assumes that all errors are introduced after the original checksums are computed on the 
matrix operands.  The reason that the errors are apparent is that the original checksums do not change
after the error is introduced.  However, when the checksums are computed in the resulting matrix and 
compared against the value of the original after the matrix operation, they will not match.

<b><u>JavaScript Floating Point Numbers</u></b><br>
<p>
JavaScript uses signed 64-bit IEEE-754 floating-point values to represent all numbers.  
There is no distinction between integers and floats.  This representation 
reserves only 52 bits for number precision.  Although integers from 0 to 4503599627370496 can be 
stored exactly, it is not guarenteed that floats in general and numbers with more than 15 significant digits
will be represented accurately.  (They will have to be rounded to the closest number that fits into the 
representation.)  
<p>
This becomes a problem because there is a higher probability that
the checksums will not match and an error will be incorrectly identified.
This is especially true during a matrix multiply since the 15 digit accuracy limit 
is reached fairly quickly.    
<p>
In order to reduce the number of incorrectly detected errors, the application takes into account 
the accuracy of the numbers in the computed matrix and rounds any floating-point
numbers that cannot be represented exactly.  This means that introducing an error by adding a digit 
to one of numbers in a matrix (i.e. changing 12.001 to 12.0012) may not be detected in the computation 
since the rounding may have occurred at a lower decimal place. 
<p>
When the number of significant digits gets too large, the 
numbers are rounded off at 15 before comparing the checksum results.  This means that an error should 
almost never be incorrectly identified.  However, the disadvantage to doing this is that once the 
checksums reach 15 digits, there is a higher probability that an actual error will not be detected.  
<p>
Also, because all numbers are rounded after 15 digits, numbers that are input with more than 15 
digits will be rounded immediately on the display as a visual indication.

<b><u>Instructions:</u></b><br>
<p>
There are two matrices upon which matrix operations can be performed.  These matrices are referred to 
as "Left" and "Right."  The Left and Right matrices are located in the top two browser frames.
The lower left frame is the control frame that is used to control most of the application.  
The lower right frame is a status frame that
displays information to the user and shows the results of the matrix operations.
The application maintains an internal state and only certain functions can be performed in each state.
Buttons not available in a particular state are shown as disabled.  The Left and Right matrices 
are initially set to a default value. 
<p>
<b>Resetting the Application</b><br>
The application can be reset at any time by pressing the "Reset" button or by pressing
"Refresh" on your browser.
<p>
<b>Editing Matrices</b><br>
The Left and Right matrices can be edited by pressing the "Edit Matrix" button under the 
corresponding matrix.  This will open up a new window that will allow you to enter data into the matrix.
The Left and Right matrices can only be edited before the checksums have been computed.
<p>
<b>Setting the Matrix Size</b> <br>
The matrices can be sized by selecting a number from the "Matrix Size" drop down.  The Left and Right
matrices are resized immediately.  
<p>
<b>Randomizing the Matrices</b> <br>
Random numbers can be inserted into the Left and Right matrices by entering a maximum value for the random 
numbers in the "Maximum Value" edit box, selecting the desired number of decimal places for the random 
numbers within the "Decimal Places" drop down and finally pressing the "Randomize Matrices" button.  This will 
fill the matrices with random numbers satisfying the parameters entered. 
<p>
<b>Computing Matrix Checksums</b> <br>
The matrix checksums can be computed by pressing the "Compute Checksums" button.  The Left and Right matrices
will be updated to display the checksum fields with a gray background.  
<p>
<b>Introducing Errors</b> <br>
Errors can be introduced into the Left and Right matrices by pressing the "Introduce Errors" button under the 
corresponding matrix.  This will open up a new window that will allow you to change the data in the matrix.
Errors can be introduced into the Left and Right matrices only after the checksums have been computed.  
<p>
<b>Performing a Matrix Operation</b> <br>
A matrix operation can be performed by selecting either "Addition" or "Multiplication" and then pressing the
"Perform Matrix Operation" button.  The results will be shown in the status frame.  Matrix operations can only
be performed after the checksums have been computed.
<p>
<b>Notes</b> <br>
This application has been tested with Internet Explorer version 6.0 and Mozilla version 1.6.
Other browsers and previous browser versions are not guaranteed to work with this application.
