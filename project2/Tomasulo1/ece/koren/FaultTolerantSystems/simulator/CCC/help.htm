<br><br>
The hypercube topology has multiple paths between nodes and a low overall diameter<br>
of n for a network of 2n nodes. However, these are achieved at the price<br>
of a high node degree. A node must have n ports, which implies that a new node<br>
design is required whenever the size of the network increases. An alternative is<br>
the Cube-Connected Cycles (CCC) which keeps the degree of a node fixed at three<br>
or less. A CCC network that corresponds to the H3 hypercube<br>

 Each node of degree three in H3 is replaced by a cycle consisting<br>
of three nodes. In general, each node of degree n in the hypercube Hn is<br>
replaced by a cycle containing n nodes where the degree of every node in the cycle<br>
is 3. The resulting CCC(n,n) network has n2n nodes. In principle, each cycle may<br>
include k nodes with k  n with the additional k . n nodes having a degree of 2.<br>
This will yield a CCC(n, k) network with k2n nodes. The extra nodes of degree 2<br>
have a very small impact on the properties that are of interest to us, and we will<br>
therefore restrict ourselves to the case k = n.<br>
The lower degree of nodes in the CCC compared to the hypercube results in a<br>
bigger diameter. Instead of a diameter of size n for the hypercube, the diameter of<br>
the CCC(n,n) is<br>
Dimeter of general CCC network<br><br>

The routing of messages in the CCC is also more complicated than that in hypercubes. <br>
The fault tolerance of the CCC is, however,<br>
higher because the failure of a single node in the CCC will only have an effect similar<br>
to that of a single faulty link in the hypercube. A closed form expression for<br>
the reliability of the CCC has not yet been derived.<br><br>
