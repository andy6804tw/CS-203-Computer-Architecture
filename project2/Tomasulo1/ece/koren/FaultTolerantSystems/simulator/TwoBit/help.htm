<p><b>Help for Two Bit Error Correction and Three Bit Error Detection Hamming

      <p>Enter a 32-bit data value, in hexadecimal format, in the entry
      box.&nbsp; This data represents the word that was originally sent to the
      memory, before any errors occurred.&nbsp; Any non-hex characters will be
      treated as &quot;0&quot; (0X0).&nbsp; Leading &quot;0&quot;s will be
      pre-pended if the value is less than 32-bits.&nbsp; Leading characters are
      truncated if the value entered is longer than 8 characters.&nbsp; Data
      input validation changes, if needed, will be displayed after the button in step 2 is
      pressed. </p>

      <p>Click on the &quot;Calculate Check Bits&quot; button to have the
      program calculate the check bits for the data that was entered in step
      1.&nbsp; The data and check bits are also put in the entry boxes for step
      3 for convenience.&nbsp; Data input validation changes for the data entered in step 1 are done in this step.</p>

      <p>Edit the values in these entry boxes to inject errors into the data or
      check bits that will be returned from memory.&nbsp;&nbsp; Data input
      validation changes similar to those in step 1 are performed as needed after the button in step 4 is pressed.&nbsp; Steps 3 and 4 can
      repeated as often as desired.</p>

  <tr>
    <td width="997" height="132"><font color="#FF0000">Step 4</font>
      <p>Click on the &quot;Decode&quot; button to have the program calculate
      the data value returned after it has been processed by the error
      correction circuit.&nbsp; Single and double bit errors injected during
      step 3 will be corrected and triple bit errors will be detected.&nbsp;
      "X"s are displayed for invalid data.&nbsp; Note that the data and status 
      returned depends only on the data and check bits from step 3.&nbsp;  
      Steps 3 and 4 can repeated as often as desired.</td>

      <p>Click on the &quot;Update Values&quot; button to have the program
      display the values in the decode circuit for the data entered in step 3
      and calculated in step 4.&nbsp; The values shown in the boxes correspond
      to the values of the same name in the diagram.&nbsp; "X"s are displayed for invalid data.</p>
