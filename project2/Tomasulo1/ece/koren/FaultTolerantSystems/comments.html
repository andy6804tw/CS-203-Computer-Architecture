"Fault attacks have recently become a serious concern in the smart card
industry.  "Fault-Tolerant Systems" provides the reader with a clear
exposition of these attacks and the protection strategies that can be 
used to thwart them. A must read for practitioners and researchers 
working in the field."<br>

"Understanding the fundamentals of an area, whether it is golf or fault 
tolerance, is a prerequisite to developing expertise in the area. 
Krishna and Koren's book can provide a reader with this underlying 
foundation for fault tolerance. This book is particularly timely because
the design of fault-tolerant computing components, such as processors 
and disks, is becoming increasingly important to the mainstream
computing industry."<br>

"Professors Koren and Krishna, have written a modern, dual purpose text
that first presents the basics fault tolerance tools describing various
redundancy types both at the hardware and software levels followed by 
current research topics. It reviews fundamental reliability modeling 
approaches, combinatorial blocks and Markov chain techniques. Notably, 
there is a complete chapter on statistical simulation
methods that offers guidance to practical evaluations as well as one on
fault-tolerant networks. All chapters, which are clearly written
including illuminating examples, have extensive reference lists whereby 
students can delve deeper into almost any topic. Several practical and 
commercial computing systems that incorporate fault tolerance are 
detailed. Furthermore, there are two chapters introducing
current fault tolerance research challenges, cryptographic systems
and defects in VLSI designs."<br>

"The field of Fault-Tolerant Computing has advanced considerably in the 
past ten years and yet no effort has been made to put together these
advances in the form of a book or a comprehensive paper for the 
students starting in this area. This is the first book I know of in the 
past 10 years that deals with hardware and software
aspects of fault tolerant computing, is very comprehensive, and is
written as a text for the course."<br>

Fault-Tolerant Systems - Foreword
<br> </STRONG> </H3>

Systems used in critical applications such as health, commerce,
transportation, utilities, and national security must be highly 
reliable.  Ubiquitous use of computing systems and other electronic 
systems in these critical areas requires that computing systems have 
high reliability. High reliability is achieved by designing
the systems to be fault-tolerant. Even though the high reliability
requirements of computing systems gave the original impetus to the 
study of the design of fault tolerant systems, trends in manufacturing 
of VLSI circuits and systems are also requiring the use of 
fault-tolerant design methods to achieve high yields from manufacturing 
plants. This is due to the fact that with reduced feature sizes of
VLSI circuit designs and shortcomings of lithographic techniques used 
in fabrication the characteristics of the manufactured devices are 
becoming unpredictable.  Additionally small sizes of devices make them 
susceptible to radiation induced failures causing run time errors. 
Thus it may be necessary to use fault tolerance techniques even in 
systems that are used in non-critical applications such as consumer
electronics.
This book covers comprehensively the design of fault-tolerant hardware 
and software, use of fault-tolerance techniques to improve manufacturing
yields and design and analysis of networks. Additionally it includes 
material on methods to protect against threats to encryption subsystems 
used for security purposes. The material in the book will help 
immensely students and practitioners in electrical and computer 
engineering and computer science in learning how to design reliable
computing systems and how to analyze fault-tolerant computing systems.
