The final manuscript (including all figures and tables) should be 
formated in the IEEE Transaction two-column format. 
A Latex style file is available at:<br>
<A href="../../../../www.ieee.org/organizations/pubs/authors.html">
http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pubs/authors.html</A>.<br> 
All papers must conform to the usual IEEE-TC requirements
(see ``Information for Authors'' on the inside cover of the 
Transactions or at the Computer Society website at
<A href="../../../../www.computer.org/author/transguide/default.htm"> http://www.computer.org/author/transguide/)</A>.<br>
<p>
After the approval of the revised manuscript by the guest editors,
the following items will have to be prepared:
<ul>
<li> 1 complete hard copy of manuscript, including:
<ul>
  <li> abstract
  <li> index terms (keywords)
  <li> author affiliation data
  <li> main text
  <li> references (bibliography)
  <li> figure captions and table titles
  <li> footnotes, if any
  <li> biography of each author (required for regular papers only
  (not short items)
</ul>
<li> 1 complete editable electronic copy of the manuscript (see
below)
<li> hard copies of all artwork (figures, tables, etc.)
<li> electronic copies of all artwork
<li> photograph of each author (hard copy or electronic) (Required
for regular papers only)
<li> complete contact information for each author (mailing address
including postal code, e-mail, phone, fax) with the corresponding 
author indicated
</ul>
Electronic File Formats:<br>
Although the Transactions Department uses Microsoft Word to edit
manuscripts, for technical reasons we prefer to receive files in the 
Tex or LaTex format.
Most common word processing formats, including Microsoft Word (DOS,
Windows, Mac), WordPerfect (DOS, Windows, Mac), RTF, and plain ASCII 
text will also be accepted. If a text formatter is used, retain codes 
that identify titles, subheads, typeface changes, symbols, and other 
attributes related to the paper's meaning. Remove codes that handle 
page layout (like margins, columns, and text size). Include all macros 
(\def) required to produce the document.
Indicate at the top of the file which formatter was used.
<p>
PostScript and PDF files as well as files created in layout programs 
such as FrameMaker, Quark Xpress, PageMaker, and Ventura are NOT 
acceptable simply because they do not provide the text of the 
manuscript in editable form.
<p>
Graphics:<br>
In the interest of quality and accuracy, the Computer Society
prefers to use author-supplied electronic art for all figures and 
complex tables.
Each individual figure or graphic must be supplied as a separate,
stand-alone file.
Figure and table files must be named with their respective numbers
and graphic type such as Fig1.tif, Fig2a.tif, Table1.eps, etc.

The preferred file format is TIFF. Other acceptable formats are
GIF, BMP, JPG, PCX, WMF and either PS or EPS. (Files submitted in PS 
or EPS format should be generated using only standard fonts, such as 
Times, Helvetica and Symbol). All other formats, including figures 
created in association with Tex and LaTex programs (e.g., FIG, XFIG, 
and EEPIC files) are unacceptable and should not be submitted.
Graphics generated using the drawing capabilities of word processing
software are also not considered acceptable electronic art submissions.

When creating your figures, use font sizes and line weights that
will reproduce clearly and accurately when sized to one column width 
(3.5 in. / 8.9cm). Do not include figure captions in a graphic file. 
Figure captions should be inserted as text in their proper places in 
the main manuscript file, or included in a separate text file.

All figures and complex tables that are not submitted in electronic
form must be submitted as high quality, camera-ready hard copies.
<p>
Encoding / Compression:<br>
Only files processed using the following methods of encoding and/or
compression are acceptable: uuencoding, mime encoding, and BinHex-ing; 
tar files, shar files; and those compressed with PK-Zip (WinZip, etc.), 
Stuffit, Z (Unix compress) or GZ (GnuZip). All other encoding and/or 
compression schemes are unacceptable.
<p>
Transmission of Electronic Materials:<br>
Will be done via ftp. Specific instructions will be provided.
<!--
Because it is the fastest, most reliable, and most convenient method, 
the Computer Society prefers to receive electronic files via ftp. Our
anonymous ftp site can be found at ftp.computer.org. Use the
/pub/incoming/trans/xx

directory, where xx is the abbreviation of the Transactions title
(e.g., tc for Transactions on Computers).
Please choose a unique, clearly identifying filename--a file called 
my-paper.tar.z is not particularly helpful. We also ask that you send 
an e-mail message to transactions@computer.org notifying us of the 
fact that you have posted a file on our ftp site and including 
appropriate information such as the title of the Transactions, the 
article title, the IEEECS log number (listed above) and the
exact name and location of the file posted.
<p>
E-mail:<br>
Although problems related to file size and the various encoding methods 
used by different e-mail software packages make this a less reliable
method, electronic files may also be transmitted as e-mail attachments. 
Use the address listed on our Web site under Addresses for Submitting 
Materials:<br>
http://www.computer.org/pubs/transguide/addresses.htm,br>
or the general address:<br>
transactions@computer.org.
<p>
Storage Media:<br>
Although we prefer receiving files via ftp, submissions on 3- or
5- inch diskettes, SyQuest disks (44, 88 or 270 MB), and CD-ROM are also
accepted.
Diskettes should be formatted DOS/Windows or Macintosh compatible.
Because we can access diskettes formatted for some, but not all, 
versions of Unix, we strongly discourage submissions on Unix diskettes.
Note on the disk label the operating system, software, and version 
numbers used to create the disk: e.g.,
Win95 / WinWord 7.0. If you must submit your electronic materials
on one of these media, we recommend using the special packaging 
materials available, and shipping them via a reputable express courier 
service.
<p>
General Notes:<br>
All electronically transmitted files should contain the following
information either as a separate, ASCII text "readme" file if using ftp,
or as part of the accompanying message if submitting by e-mail: the 
Transactions title, the article title, the IEEECS log number (listed 
above), the author's name, and the software used to generate the 
manuscript.
-->
<p>
NOTICE<br>
It is essential that the electronic versions of the manuscript and
artwork include all the same materials as the hard copies, and the 
content must match the hard copy exactly! Also, we cannot overemphasize 
the importance of the quality and accuracy of the content of the 
electronic materials submitted since the content is not recreated, but 
merely transformed into the final published version.
<p>
MORE INFORMATION<br>
Please consult our Web site for the most up-to-date details on
acceptable formats and submission procedures for specific items. If you 
have questions or problems, please feel free to contact the IEEE 
Computer Society Transactions Department for help.
