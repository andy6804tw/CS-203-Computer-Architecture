  Original manuscripts are sought for a special issue of the IEEE
  Transactions on Computers on computer arithmetic. The special
issue is scheduled for July 2000. Topics of interest are recent
advances in all aspects of computer arithmetic, including, but not 
limited to the following topics:
<ul>

      <li> Foundations of number systems and arithmetic;
      <li> Arithmetic processor design and implementation;
      <li> Arithmetic algorithms and their analysis;
      <li> Highly parallel arithmetic units and systems;
      <li> New floating point chips, boards and systems;
      <li> Standards for number representation and arithmetic;
      <li> Impact of high level languages on arithmetic systems;
      <li> Special function implementation;
      <li> Applications of computer arithmetic:
           Cryptography, DSP, data compression, etc.
</ul>
Manuscripts should be submitted electronically (in postscript
format) through /ece/koren/sp-issue, no later
than September 1, 1999.  
<p>
Papers for the special issue are no longer accepted.

<p>
In addition, a signed <a href="copyrt_sp.ps">IEEE copyright transfer 
form</a> should be mailed to one of the guest editors. 
If you are unable to submit your paper electronically you may send six 
copies of the manuscript to one of the two guest editors before 
September 1, 1999. 
All papers must conform to the usual IEEE-TC submission requirements
  with total length, including figures and tables, not to exceed 35
 double-spaced pages (see ``Information for Authors'' on the inside
 cover of the Transactions or at the Computer Society website at
  <A href="../../../../www.computer.org/author/transguide/default.htm"> http://www.computer.org/author/transguide/)</A>. 
  Papers should be of high quality and in final form that will not
  require major revisions, since this special issue is under a
tight
  schedule. Submitted manuscripts must not have been previously
  published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.
