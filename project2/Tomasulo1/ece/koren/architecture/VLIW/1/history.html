Microprogrammed <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr>s have a macroinstruction that corresponds to each program instruction.  Each of these macroinstructions has a corresponding sequence of microinstructions, kept in <abbr title="Read-only memory">ROM</abbr> on the <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr>.  These microinstructions can be ordered into wide sets of control signals.  This is called horizontal microprogramming.</p><p>When Joseph Fisher was working on writing horizontal microcode for a CDC-6600 emulator in 1979, he began to work on the problem of generating long instruction words from short sequential instructions.  The techniques he developed, called "trace scheduling" (which will be discussed in detail later), were essential for generating <abbr title="Very Long Instruction Word">VLIW</abbr>-compatible code.</p><p>In 1984, Fisher and colleagues from Yale University formed <a href="../../../../../../wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi@Multiflow+Computer">Multiflow</a>, with the goal of creating <abbr title="Very Long Instruction Word">VLIW</abbr> supercomputers.  Cydrome also was formed that year by Bob Rau.  Although they both released finished products, the marketplace was not ready, nor was the technology complete.  As such, neither company managed much commercial success, and both have since folded.  But they have continued to refine <abbr title="Very Long Instruction Word">VLIW</abbr> technology, and both founders are now bringing their expertise to <a href="../../../../../../www.hpl.hp.com/default.htm">Hewlett-Packard Labs</a>, which has produced the <a href="../../../../../../www.hpl.hp.com/research/itc/car/tech_reports/TRPlayDohR1.pdf">Playdoh research machine</a> [PDF].</p><p>Once these pioneering companies disappeared, little development appeared to happen on the <abbr title="Very Long Instruction Word">VLIW</abbr> front, until engineers found the architecture was ideal for quick computation of complex, repetitive algorithms.  Thus the re-emergence of <abbr title="Very Long Instruction Word">VLIW</abbr> came with a new wave of media processing chips, led by <a href="../../../../../../bmrc.berkeley.edu/courseware/cs298/spring96/w2.html">Chromatic's MPact</a> and <a href="../../../../../../www.semiconductors.philips.com/platforms/nexperia/media_processing/default.htm">Philips's TriMedia</a>, which led to the development of the first really publicly successful <abbr title="Very Long Instruction Word">VLIW</abbr> implementation: the <a href="../../../../../../www.ti.com/default.htm">Texas Instruments</a> C6X series, which is discussed in greater detail in the implementation section of this site.</p><p>The huge success of <abbr title="Texas Instruments">TI</abbr>'s DSP chips paved the way for a new generation of large-scale <abbr title="Very Long Instruction Word">VLIW</abbr> microprocessor designs.  In 2000, startup <a href="../../../../../../www.transmeta.com/default.htm">Transmeta</a> released their family of <abbr title="Very Long Instruction Word">VLIW</abbr>-based Crusoe processors, designed especially for low-power processing in embedded devices.  <a href="../../../../../../www.intel.com/default.htm">Intel</a> followed with their 64-bit architecture specification, IA-64, and has continued with the Itanium line of chips.</p><p><abbr title="Very Long Instruction Word">VLIW</abbr>'s emergence is a matter of the right technology available at the right time.  In the 1970s, <abbr title="Very Long Instruction Word">VLIW</abbr> was nearly un-implementable due to the prohibitively expensive nature of memory at the time.  <abbr title="Complex Instructions Set Chip">CISC</abbr> processors could be made to use as little as eight bits for a simple instruction, making it the technology of choice.  These days, however, memory is inexpensive, and <abbr title="Very Long Instruction Word">VLIW</abbr> is again a viable solution.</p>	<!-- back/forward navigation -->		<table border="0" width="100%">			<tr>				<td align="left"><a href="default.htm">&#171; Previous</a></td>				<td align="right"><a href="difficulties.html">Next &#187;</a></td>			</tr>		</table>	</td>	<td width="5%"><p>&nbsp;</p></td>	<!-- global navigation -->	<td class="globalnav" valign="top" width="30%">		<h2>Navigation</h2>		<ul>			<li><a href="../vliw.html">Introduction</a></li>			<li>All about VLIW				<ul>					<li><a href="default.htm">Description</a></li>					<li><a href="history.html">History</a></li>					<li><a href="difficulties.html">Difficulties of Implementation</a></li>				</ul>			</li>			<li>Implementations				<ul>					<li><a href="../2/crusoe1.html">Transmeta Crusoe overview</a></li>					<il><a href="../2/crusoe2.html">Crusoe and Code Morphing</a></li>					<li><a href="../2/ti1.html">Texas Instruments C6X</a></li>				</ul>			</li>			<li>Applications				<ul>					<li><a href="../3/applications.html">VLIW Applications Example</a></li>				</ul>			</li>			<li><a href="../references.html">References</a></li>		</ul>	</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
