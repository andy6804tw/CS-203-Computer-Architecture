This is not an easy process.  Early <abbr title="Very Long Instruction Word">VLIW</abbr> implementations looked only into basic program blocks to obtain <abbr title="Instruction Level Parallelism">ILP</abbr>, and could not follow complex branches.  As such, little optimization was possible.   Authoring a compiler to effectively predict code paths is easily the largest hurdle of <abbr title="Very Long Instruction Word">VLIW</abbr> design.  It is also one of the biggest potential advantages of <abbr title="Very Long Instruction Word">VLIW</abbr>--as die sizes become smaller and interconnect delays become more debilitating to chip performance, more of on-chip processing will need to happen at the software level.</p><p>Another big problem is that any <abbr title="Very Long Instruction Word">VLIW</abbr>-compatible code is largely proprietary to the hardware of the chip it is designed for.  Code written for a processor using five execution units will be incompatible with one using seven.  The inflexibility inherent in microchip design makes this a problem.  Modern <abbr title="Complex Instruction Set Chip">CISC</abbr> chips still need to be compatible with x86 standards from the 1980s.  Transmeta has addressed this problem with the development of its Code Morphing technology that allows x86 code to be run on its Crusoe chips, but this problem remains a major stumbling block for corporate <abbr title="Very Long Instruction Word">VLIW</abbr> implementations.</p><p><abbr title="Very Long Instruction Word">VLIW</abbr> also has some problems with the inflexibility of its compiler-first design.  Since instructions are ordered at compile time, any unanticipated memory conflicts that occur (e.g., latency, cache misses) can not be accounted for without deviation from a pure <abbr title="Very Long Instruction Word">VLIW</abbr> design; that is, adding superscalar elements to the processor.</p>	<!-- back/forward navigation -->		<table border="0" width="100%">			<tr>				<td align="left"><a href="history.html">&#171; Previous</a></td>				<td align="right"><a href="../2/crusoe1.html">Next &#187;</a></td>			</tr>		</table>	</td>	<td width="5%"><p>&nbsp;</p></td>	<!-- global navigation -->	<td class="globalnav" valign="top" width="30%">		<h2>Navigation</h2>		<ul>			<li><a href="../vliw.html">Introduction</a></li>			<li>All about VLIW				<ul>					<li><a href="default.htm">Description</a></li>					<li><a href="history.html">History</a></li>					<li><a href="difficulties.html">Difficulties of Implementation</a></li>				</ul>			</li>			<li>Implementations				<ul>					<li><a href="../2/crusoe1.html">Transmeta Crusoe overview</a></li>					<il><a href="../2/crusoe2.html">Crusoe and Code Morphing</a></li>					<li><a href="../2/ti1.html">Texas Instruments C6X</a></li>				</ul>			</li>			<li>Applications				<ul>					<li><a href="../3/applications.html">VLIW Applications Example</a></li>				</ul>			</li>			<li><a href="../references.html">References</a></li>		</ul>	</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
