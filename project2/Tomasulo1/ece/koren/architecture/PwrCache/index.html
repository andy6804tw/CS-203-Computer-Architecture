<h2><center>ANALYTICAL ESTIMATION OF ENERGY DISSIPATION IN CACHES</center></h2>

<p><h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>State of the art microprocessors have one or more levels of on-chip caches. The trend is to increase the cache memory with the increasing transistor budget, because off-chip accesses are atleast an order of magnitude slower. By confining memory accesses on-chip, single cycle memory access latency can be achieved using Static RAMs. There is the added advantage of reducing power because driving signals through high capacitance I/O pads is less frequent.  An examination of the die photos of high-end microprocessors show that anywhere from 15% to 40% of the die area is dedicated to on-chip caches.[1]

<p>This tool for Energy dissipation in Caches is based on the paper," Analytical Energy Dissipation Models for Low Power Caches", by Milind B. Kamble and Kanad Ghose[1].<a href = "extra.htm">Summary</a>

<br><h3>Tools:</h3>
<p>The following tools have been provided for obtaining the Energy dissipated in the cache. The tools are designed for a set-associative cache and hence can also be utilized for the direct mapped cache and the fully associative cache as they are special cases of the set associative cache.<p>

<a href = "energy.htm">1)	Tool for determining Energy dissipation:</a> This tool allows the user to enter various values inputs and computes the individual energy dissipation elements as well as the total energy dissipated. A graphical representation is also provided to show the ratio of the various energy dissipations.<br>
