/* Tips for Elastic layouts
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust based on your final font sizing.

      <p align="justify" class="style1">It has  been reported that the instruction cache consumes a significant  fraction of the total processor power. For e.g. 27% of the processor  power is dissipated in the L1 instruction cache in Strong ARM 110.  Cache partitioning is commonly used to reduce the dynamic power  dissipation of caches since a smaller cache has a lower load  capacitance. Block buffering proposes to buffer the last accessed cache  line. If the data in the same cache line is accessed on the next  request, only the buffer needs to be accessed. The filter cache adds a  bigger buffer (L0 cache) to cache recently accessed cache blocks. On  each access, the L0 cache is 1st accessed. The L1cache is only accessed  when an L0 miss occurs. This approach can achieve more energy reduction  compared with the block buffering mechanism; however, it could cause  significant performance degradation if an applicationâ€™s working set  cannot be captured in the small L0 cache. This performance degradation  could be as high as 20%. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><span class="style3">HotSpot</span>  cache is a novel instruction cache architecture in which a dynamic  steering mechanism is employed to direct a request to either the L0  cache or the L1 cache (unlike a filter cache where the L0 and L1 caches  are accessed sequentially). The design goal is to achieve energy  savings comparable to the filter cache without sacrificing performance.</p>
