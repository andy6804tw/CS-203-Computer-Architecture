<P>There are three important considerations while making a selection as
to which RAID level is to be used for a system viz. cost, performance and
reliability.

<P>There are many different ways to measure these parameters for eg. performance
could be measured as I/Os per second per dollar, bytes per second or response
time. We could also compare systems at the same cost, the same total user
capacity, the same performance or the same reliability. The method used
largely depends on the application and the reason to compare. For example,
in transaction processing applications the primary base for comparison
would be I/Os per second per dollar while in scientific applications we
would be more interested in bytes per second per dollar. In some heterogeneous
systems like file servers both I/O per second and bytes per second may
be important. Sometimes it is important to consider reliability as the
base for comparison.

<P>Taking a closer look at the RAID levels we observe that most of the
levels are similar to each other. RAID level 1 and RAID level 3 disk arrays
can be viewed as a subclass of RAID level 5 disk arrays. Also RAID level
2 and RAID level 4 disk arrays are generally found to be inferior to RAID
level 5 disk arrays. Hence the problem of selecting among RAID levels 1
through 5 is a subset of the more general problem of choosing an appropriate
parity group size and striping unit for RAID level 5 disk arrays.

<P>Given below is a table that compares the throughput of various redundancy
schemes for four types of I/O requests. The I/O requests are basically
reads and writes which are divided into small (reads &amp; writes) and
large ones. Remembering the fact that our data has been spread over multiple
disks (data striping), a small refers to an I/O request of one striping
unit while a large I/O request refers to requests of one full stripe (one
stripe unit from each disk in an error correcting group).

<P>The table above tabulates the maximum throughput per dollar relative
level 0 for RAID levels 0, 1, 3, 5 and 6.&nbsp; For practical purposes
we consider RAID levels 2 &amp; 4 inferior to RAID level 5 disk arrays,
so we don't show the comparisons. The cost of a system is directly proportional
to the number of disks it uses in the disk array. Thus the table shows
us that given equivalent cost RAID level 0 and RAID level 1 systems, the
RAID level 1 system can sustain half the number of small writes per second
that a RAID level 0 system can sustain. Equivalently the cost of small
writes is twice as expensive in a RAID level 1 system as in a RAID level
0 system.

<P>The table also shows storage efficiency of each RAID level. The storage
efficiency is approximately inverse the cost of each unit of user capacity
relative to a RAID level 0 system. The <A HREF="raidiator.html">storage
efficiency</A> is equal to the performance/cost metric for large writes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The figures above graph the performance/cost metrics from the table
above for RAID levels 1, 3, 5 and 6 over a range of parity group sizes.
The performance/cost of RAID level 1 systems is equivalent to the performance/cost
of RAID level 5 systems when the parity group size is equal to 2. The performance/cost
of RAID level 3 systems is always less than or equal to the performance/cost
of RAID level 5 systems. This is expected given that a RAID level 3 system
is a subclass of RAID level 5 systems derived by restricting the striping
unit size such that all requests access exactly a parity stripe of data.
Since the configuration of RAID level 5 systems is not subject to such
a restriction, the performance/cost of RAID level 5 systems can never be
less than that of an equivalent RAID level 3 system. Of course such generalizations
are specific to the models of disk arrays used in the above experiments.
In reality, a specific implementation of a RAID level 3 system can have
better performance/cost than a specific implementation of a RAID level
5 system.

<P>The question of which RAID level to use is better expressed as more
general configuration questions concerning the size of the parity group
and striping unit. For a parity group size of 2, mirroring is desirable,
while for a very small striping unit RAID level 3 would be suited.

<P>The figure below plots the performance/cost metrics from the table above
for RAID levels 3, 5 &amp; 6.
