    <p align="left" style="margin: 0">Now we are in the clock 6, all the instructions
    have been issued but there is data dependencies among the last 4
    instructions with the 2 first instructions, therefore they can't start
    execution even when they have been issued. In this clock 6, the second
    instruction has finished executing and in the next clock will write its
    result, note that there are 3 instructions&nbsp; waiting for this
    result:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MULTD F0,F2,F4&nbsp; ,&nbsp;&nbsp;
    SUBD F10,F0,F6&nbsp;&nbsp; and ADDD F6,F8,F2</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">In clock 7, the Load instruction writes its result in the
    instruction station and forward the result to the Register file station, F2
    holds now the value LD1, this value is send to all the units that were
    waiting for this result. Therefore the instruction&nbsp;&nbsp; MULTD
    F0,F2,F4&nbsp;&nbsp; can start execution, the other two
    instructions&nbsp;&nbsp; SUBD F10,F0,F6&nbsp; and&nbsp; ADDD F6,F8,F2 can't
    start execution yet because they still have data dependencies, check the
    field Qj in the Reservation Station to find out who are they waiting for.</li>

    <p align="left" style="margin: 0">In clock 17 the multiplication ends and in
    the next clock it will write its result, can you tell now which instructions
    are going to start execution?</li>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left" style="margin: 0">As you figured it out, the instructions
    that were waiting to the multiplication to finish now have all its data and
    can start execution.</li>
