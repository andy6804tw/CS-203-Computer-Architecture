<p align="left" style="margin: 0"><b>STEP 1:&nbsp; </b><i>Select The set of
instructions you want to execute</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left" style="margin: 0">For the Load and Store instructions, LD
    and SD respectively, you can edit the fields of the instruction. The first
    editable component can be changed&nbsp; to:&nbsp; F0 - F16 or any integer
    number. The second editable component can be changed to any R#</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="view2.jpg" width="640" height="277"></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">In all the instruction you can use the popup menu to select
    a pre-entered value. The same applies for selecting the number of executions
    for the Functional Units.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="popup.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p align="left" style="margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin: 0"><b>STEP 2:&nbsp; </b><i>Start Execution</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left" style="margin: 0">To start the execution press the button
    Execute, or the keys alt-E.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left" style="margin: 0"><b>STEP 3:&nbsp; </b><i>Execute the algorithm
step by step</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left" style="margin: 0">To execute step by step press the button
    Next, or the keys alt-N.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left" style="margin: 0">In this example: LD F6,F14,R2, has being
    issued in the clock 1, the address (F14)+(R2) was calculated, and started
    its execution in the clock 2, adding the stamp &lt;Executing&gt;. In the
    clock 2 as well, the next instruction LD F2, -47(R109) was issued and its
    address was calculated, note that it hasn't start execution yet thus why it
    doesn't have the stamp &lt;Executing&gt;.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="view3.jpg" width="640" height="477"></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left" style="margin: 0">In this example the second instruction LD
    F2,F6,R3, has&nbsp; data dependency with the first instruction issued ADD
    F6,F8,F0. Therefore the Functional Unit of the Load/Store Unit is waiting
    for the result of F6 which is provided by Add1. The Load instruction is
    issued because there are loads units available but it won't start executing
    until it gets the result of the Add1.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="view4.jpg" width="640" height="477"></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left" style="margin: 0">Once the first instruction ADD F6,F8,F0
    has finished (clock number 4)&nbsp; it would write "val (ADD1)" to all pending stations, here the caps indicates that the data
    is coming from the Functional unit Add1; and the prefix val indicates that this is an actual value-result. The Load/Store Unit which was
    waiting for the result of F6 gets the value in this clock and calculate the
    address to start execution in the next clock.</li>
