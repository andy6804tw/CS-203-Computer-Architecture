<H3> <STRONG> Digital Computer Arithmetic (ECE666) - Suggested
Projects </STRONG> </H3>
Notes:<br> 
(1) Delay calculation means that the user can enter basic delay
parameters and the simulator will calculate the final delay (with
possibly an attempt to minimize it).<br>
(2) It is highly recommended to try out as many of the currently
available simulators as possible, to have a better idea on how
such simulators work, what type of inputs they allow and use some 
of their code whenever possible.<br>
(3) You may either suggest some modification of a project listed
below or suggest a different project altogether. You should email
me your proposal for approval and to "reserve" the selected project.

<!--
<LI> A array multiplier for 2's complement numbers with delay 
calculation.
<LI> Demonstrate the CLOSE and FAR cases in floating-point 
subtraction, see pp. 82-84.
<LI> A balanced tree design with delay calculation (similar to the
overturned-stairs one)
<LI> A leading 0's detector with delay calculation (several designs
are available in the literature).
<LI> Various prefix adders with delay calculation.
-->
<LI> A multiplier by a constant operand.
<LI> A squarer.
<LI> A (4;2) compressor-based tree showing also a simplified layout
with delay calculation which will also take wiring delays into
account.
<LI> Addition and subtraction in a hybrid SD system (see problem
2.14 on p. 33). 
<LI> A multi-level combinatorial shifter with delay calculation.
<LI> Modify the Radix-4 division simulator to show the P-D plot
and the steps for non-redundant and redundant remainder.
<LI> A radix 8 and/or 16 SRT divider with overlapping radix 2 or 4
stages.
<LI> Rewrite the Division by reciprocation module which does not
work properly.
<LI> Faster algorithms for elementary function evaluation (see for
example, the book by Muller, ref. [11] on p. 246 and other
references).
