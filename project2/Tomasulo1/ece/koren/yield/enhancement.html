<H2> Abstract</H2>
The ability to improve the yield of integrated circuits through
layout modification has been recognized, and several techniques
for yield enhanced routing and compaction have been developed.
Still, yield issues are rarely a factor in the choice of the
floorplan mainly due to the tendency to focus on the more important
timing and area objectives.
Consequently, floorplanning tools have been developed with only
these primary objectives in mind.
We show in this paper that it is possible to generate a better
floorplan with respect to yield, with very little penalty in the
main objectives.
We describe a constructive floorplanning approach which is based on
analytical techniques and produces near optimal floorplans in
terms of area utilization, wiring length and yield.

<H2> Abstract</H2>
The ability to improve the yield of integrated circuits through 
layout modification has been recognized and several techniques
for yield enhanced routing and compaction have been developed.
Yield improvement during routing is however, limited by the
predetermined placement. 
It is conceivable therefore, that different placements of the modules 
(e.g., standard or custom cells) may lead to very different yield 
enhanced routings with different projected yields. 
This is conceptually similar to the effect that the floorplanning
of the entire chip has on the yield \cite{p2}, but while chip 
floorplanning deals with the major building blocks, placement 
deals with the modules within an individual block.
Yield enhanced placement of modules has not been attempted before
mainly due to the difficulty of estimating the yield of the block 
before the routing is done.
Recently, a technique for estimating the yield prior to the routing
has been developed making it possible to modify the
placement in order to achieve higher yield.
The goals of this paper are to investigate the effect that placement
has on the projected yield and to modify a standard cell placement
algorithm so that yield becomes a design objective.

<H2> Incorporating Yield Enhancement into the Floorplanning Process</H2>

<H2> Abstract</H2>
The traditional goals of the floorplanning
process for a new integrated circuit  have been 
minimizing the total chip area and reducing the routing cost, i.e., the
total length of the interconnecting wires.
Recently, it has been shown that for certain types of chips,
the floorplan can 
affect the yield of the chip as well. 
Consequently, it becomes desirable to consider the expected yield, in 
addition to the cost of routing, when selecting a floorplan.

The goal of this paper is to investigate the two seemingly unrelated,
and often conflicting, objectives of yield enhancement and routing 
complexity minimization. We analyze the possible trade-offs between 
the two, and then
present a constructive algorithm for incorporating the yield 
enhancement as a secondary objective
into the floorplanning process, with the main objective still being 
the minimization of the overall routing costs.

<H2> Abstract</H2>
Traditionally the floorplan of a chip has been determined so as to
minimize the total chip area and reduce the routing costs.
Recently, it has been shown that the floorplan also affects the yield
of the chip. 
Consequently, it becomes desirable to consider the expected yield, in 
addition to the cost of routing, when selecting a floorplan.

The goal of this paper is to study the two seemingly disjoint objectives
of yield enhancement and routing complexity minimization, and find out
whether they lead to different optimal floorplans,
resulting in a need for a tradeoff analysis.

<H2> Abstract</H2>
Until recently, VLSI designers rarely considered yield issues when
selecting a floorplan for a newly designed chip. This paper
demonstrates that for large area VLSI chips, especially those 
that incorporate some fault tolerance, changes in the floorplan can
affect the projected yield. We study several general floorplan
structures, make some specific recommendations, and apply them to
actual VLSI chips. We conclude that the floorplan of a chip can
affect its projected yield in a non-negligible way, for chips with
or without fault-tolerance.

<H1> Abstract</H1>
Several yield enhancement techniques are proposed for the last two
stages of VLSI design, i.e., topological/symbolic and physical layout
synthesis. Our approach is based on modifications of the
symbolic/physical layout to reduce the sensitivity of the design to
random point defects without increasing the area, rather than fault
tolerance techniques. A layout compaction algorithm is presented and
the yield improvement results of some industrial layout examples are
shown. This algorithm has been implemented in a commercial CAD
framework. Some routing techniques for wire length and via
minimization are presented and the results of wire length reduction in
benchmark routing examples are shown. We demonstrate through
topological optimization for PLA-based designs that yield enhancement
can be applied even at a higher level of design abstraction.
Experimental results show that it is possible to achieve significant
yield improvements without increasing the layout area by applying
the proposed techniques during layout synthesis.

<H1> Abstract</H1>
In this paper, two algorithms for layer assignment with the goal of
yield enhancement are proposed. In the first, vias in an existing
layout are moved in order to decrease its sensitivity to defects. A
greedy algorithm for achieving this objective is presented. In the
second, we formulate the layer assignment problem as a network
bipartitioning problem. By applying the primal-dual algorithm (a
variation of the Kernighan-Lin algorithm), the objective of critical
area minimization can be achieved. These two methods are applied to a
set of benchmark circuits to demonstrate their effectiveness.

<H1> Abstract</H1>
For advanced submicron VLSI technologies maintaining higher
performance and better yield is a challenging task. Layout
optimization for improving yield may affect the circuit performance
and vice versa. We analyze the effect of layout modifications for 
parasitic capacitance reduction on yield in this paper. Our results
show that the solutions to the yield enhancement and parasitic
capacitance reduction problems are very close to each other.

<H1> Abstract</H1>
It is widely recognized that interconnects will be the main
bottleneck in enhancing the performance of future deep sub-micron VLSI 
designs. Interconnects do not ``scale'' well with decreasing feature
sizes and therefore dominate the delays in the integrated circuit.
In addition to RC delays, crosstalk noise also contributes significantly
to the delays experienced by a signal. Interconnects are more
susceptible 
to manufacturing defects and therefore affect the product yields 
significantly. Recently, several channel-routing based solutions have 
been proposed to minimize crosstalk noise and also enhance yield of the
routing. While these approaches are effective, they do not provide 
maximized benefits as they are either constrained by a particular 
design methodology or are post-routing steps which have very little 
scope for significant improvement.
Also, design for manufacturability objectives have not been fully
exploited by VLSI CAD tools as they do not integrate seamlessly into the
conventional design flow and the added overheads make it less
attractive. In this paper, we propose a modified routing algorithm that
maximizes yield and reduces crosstalk noise while using minimal area 
for the routing. The yield enhancement objective has been integrated 
into the routing phase as a 
preferred constraint (a constraint that will be satisfied only if the 
primary constraints of minimal area and wire length have been satisfied)
and fits well into the conventional design flow. This enables the
router to produce an output which provides maximum achievable critical 
area reduction 
for the given routing solution. Post-routing layout modification is also
done with the objective of minimizing the interaction area between the 
interconnects by exploiting the gridless property of the router.  The 
above algorithm is incorporated into GLITTER (the gridless, variable 
width channel router), and the results on channel-routing benchmarks are
presented. These 
results show a significant reduction in the critical area
achievable by using the proposed algorithm.

<H1> Abstract</H1>
For VLSI application-specific arrays and other regular VLSI 
circuits, two techniques are available for yield enhancement, 
namely defect-tolerance and layout modifications.  In this paper, 
we compare these two yield enhancement approaches by using adders 
as an example. Our yield projections indicate that the layout 
modification technique is more efficient when the defect density is
low, while reconfiguration is more efficient for a high defect
density. However, from the point of the view of effective yield, 
the layout modification is superior to defect tolerance in the 
practical range of defect density.
