<H2> Abstract</H2>
The reliability of ADCs used in highly critical systems can be
increased by applying a two-step procedure starting with
sensitivity analysis followed by redesign. The
sensitivity analysis is used to identify the most sensitive
blocks which could then be redesigned for better reliability by
incorporating fault tolerance.
This paper illustrates the steps involved in incorporating fault
tolerance in an ADC. Two redesign techniques to improve the 
reliability of a circuit are presented. Novel selective node 
resizing algorithms for increased tolerance
against alpha-particle induced transients are discussed.

<H2> Abstract</H2>
Reliability of systems used in space,  avionic and
biomedical applications is highly critical. Such systems consist
of an analog front-end to collect data, an ADC to convert the
collected data to digital form and a digital unit to process it. The
reliability of these systems is affected by the ability of its
constituent blocks to tolerate faults. Therefore, it is
necessary to increase the reliability of ADCs
to ensure a highly reliable critical system.
This paper illustrates the steps involved in the reliability
enhancement of ADCs by first proposing a methodology for fault 
sensitivity analysis and
then illustrating redesign techniques to improve the reliability
of the highly sensitive(to faults) blocks.

<H2> Abstract</H2>
Color digital imagers contain Red, Green and Blue subpixels within
each color pixel.  Defects that develop either at fabrication time or
due to environmentally induced errors over time can cause a single 
color subpixel (e.g., R) to fail, while leaving the remaining colors
intact.  This paper investigates seven software correction
algorithms that interpolate the color of a pixel based on its
nearest neighbors.  Using several measurements of color error, all
seven methods were investigated for a large number of digital
images.  Interpolations using only information from the single 
failed color (e.g., R) in
the neighbors gave the poorest results.  Those using all color
measurements and a quadratic interpolation formula, combined with
the remaining subpixel colors (e.g., G and B) produced
significantly better results.  A formula developed using the CIE
color
coordinates of Tristimulus values (X, Y, Z) yielded the best results.

<H2> Abstract</H2>
Reliability of systems used in space, avionic and biomedical 
applications is highly critical. Such systems consist of an analog 
front-end to collect data, an ADC to convert the collected data 
to digital form and a digital unit to process it. It is important
to analyze the fault sensitivities of each of these to effectively
gauge and improve the reliability of the system. 
This paper addresses the issue of fault sensitivity of ADCs.
A generic methodology for analyzing the fault sensitivity of     
ADCs is presented. A novel concept of ``node weights" specific to 
alpha-particle induced transient faults is
introduced to increase the accuracy of such an analysis.

<H2> Abstract</H2>
Digital cameras on-a-chip are becoming more common and are 
expected to be used in many industrial and consumer products. 
With the size of the CMOS active pixel-array implemented in 
such chips increasing to 512 x 512 and beyond,
the possibility of degradation in the reliability of the chip 
over time must be a factor in the chip design. 

In digital circuits, a commonly used technique for reliability 
or yield enhancement is the incorporation of redundancy (e.g.,  
adding redundant rows and columns in large memory ICs). 
Very limited attempts have been directed towards fault-tolerance in
analog circuits, mainly due to the very high level of irregularity
in their design. 
Since active pixel arrays have a regular structure, they are
amenable to reliability enhancement through a limited amount  
of added redundancy.
The purpose of this paper is to investigate  the advantages
of incorporating some fault-tolerance
methods, including redundancy, into the design of 
an active pixel sensor array.

<H2> Abstract</H2>
In this paper we study two important reliability issues in deep
submicron VLSI design, namely antenna effect and crosstalk noise, in
the context of three-layer channel routing. Cost functions for both of
the failure mechanisms are introduced and based on these cost models,
reliability enhancement techniques are presented. For antenna effect
minimization, a layer reassignment algorithm is adopted while for
crosstalk minimization, an algorithm that combines layer reassignment
and track reassignment is presented. Experimental results show that
these algorithms can reduce the antenna effect and the crosstalk noise
considerably without increasing the routing area. The relationship
between these two objectives has also been studied and a technique for
optimizing them simultaneously is proposed.

<H2> Abstract</H2>
Crosstalk has become a major issue in VLSI design due to
the high frequency, long interconnecting lines and small spacing between
interconnects in today's integrated circuits. In this paper, we study
the problem of crosstalk minimization in 3-layer HVH channel routing.
A heuristic algorithm that combines layer reassignment and track
reassignment is presented. This algorithm can iteratively
modify the layout so that the crosstalk in the channel is
minimized. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can
reduce the crosstalk by an average of 16.4% on a set of benchmark
examples.

<H2> Abstract</H2>
As semiconductor devices enter the deep sub-micron era, reliability has
become a major issue and challenge in VLSI design. Among all the
failure mechanisms, hot-carrier effect is one of those which have the
most significant impact on the long-term reliability of high-density
VLSI circuits.  In this paper, we address the problem of minimizing
hot-carrier effect during the technology mapping stage of VLSI logic
synthesis. We first present a logic-level hot-carrier model, and then,
based on this model, we propose a technology mapping algorithm for
hot-carrier effect minimization. The proposed algorithm has been
implemented in the framework of the Berkeley logic optimization package
SIS. Our results show that an average of 29.1% decrease in hot-carrier
effect can be achieved by carefully choosing logic gates from cell
libraries to implement given logic functions for a set of benchmarks.
It has also been observed that the best design for hot-carrier effect
minimization does not necessarily coincide with the best design for
low power, which has long been considered as a rough measure for VLSI
reliability.

<H2> Abstract</H2>
As semiconductor technology enters the deep submicron era, reliability
has become a major challenge in the design and manufacturing of next
generation VLSI circuits. In this paper we focus on one reliability
issue - the antenna effect in the context of 3-layer channel
routing. We first present an antenna effect model in 3-layer channel
routing and, based on this, an antenna effect cost function is
proposed. A layer reassignment approach is adopted to minimize this
cost function and we show that the layer reassignment problem can be
formulated as a network bipartitioning problem.  Experimental results
show that the antenna effect can be reduced considerably by applying
the proposed technique. Compared with previous work, one advantage of
our approach is that no extra channel area is required for antenna
effect minimization. We show that layer reassignment technique can be
used in yield-related critical area minimization in 3-layer channel
routing as well. The trade-off between these two objectives is also
presented.

<H2> Abstract</H2>
The effect of non-catastrophic (or soft) defects (i.e., neither short
nor open) on long interconnection lines is analyzed and an estimate 
is derived for the frequency-dependent critical area for such lines.
The analysis is based on a transmission-line model of interconnection
lines, and the reflections caused by the defect are taken into 
account.  This analysis results in an estimated prediction of 
the parametric yield, and a practical recommendation for a better 
jog insertion in VLSI routing.
