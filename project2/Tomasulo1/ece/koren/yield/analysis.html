<H2> Abstract</H2>
Integrated Circuit manufacturing complexities have resulted in
decreasing product yields and reliabilities. This process has
been accelerated with the advent of very deep sub-micron 
technologies coupled with the introduction of newer materials 
and technologies like copper interconnects, silicon-on-insulator 
and increased wafer sizes. The need to improve product yields
has been recognized and currently  some yield enhancement
techniques are used in industry CAD tools. Still, the significant
increase in problem size implies that considerable time and effort
can be saved if the designer could predict the yield of each
design stage. <br>
In this paper we undertake an effort to derive bounds
on the yield of the routing for a given placement.
When the design is routed, resulting in a  yield which is
significantly smaller than
the bound, the designer can choose to change the router cost
functions, modify the placement or even
re-design the unit in an attempt to increase the yield.<br>
We compare the bounds on yield obtained for a set of standard
benchmarks against exact yield values for the ``vanilla'' routings, and
the run times needed to calculate the two.
The results indicate that reasonably good estimates of yield
can be obtained in significantly lower amounts of run time.
The accuracy of the estimates increases when larger designs are
considered as the simplifying assumptions made in the
model no longer influence the estimates significantly.

<H2> Abstract</H2>
Recent increases in the density and size of memory ICs made it 
necessary to search for new defect tolerance techniques since the
traditional methods are no longer effective enough. 
Several new such schemes have been recently proposed and implemented.
Due to the high complexity of these new techniques compared to the
simple row and column redundancy,  Monte-Carlo
simulations were used to evaluate their yield enhancement. 
In this paper we present a yield analysis of one such new design
and compare its yield to that of the traditional design.

<H2> Abstract</H2>
Current VLSI technology allows the manufacture of large-area
integrated circuits with sub-micron feature sizes,
enabling designs with several millions of devices.
However, imperfections in the fabrication process result in 
yield-reducing manufacturing defects, whose severity
grows proportionally with the size and density of the chip.
Consequently, the development and use of yield enhancement
techniques at the design stage, to complement existing efforts at
the manufacturing stage, is economically justifiable.
Design-stage yield enhancement techniques are aimed at making
the integrated circuit {\em defect-tolerant}, i.e., less
sensitive to manufacturing defects, and  
they include incorporating redundancy into the
design, modifying the circuit floorplan and modifying its layout.

Successful designs of defect-tolerant chips must rely on 
accurate yield projections. 
This paper reviews the currently used statistical yield prediction
models and their application to defect-tolerant designs.  We then 
provide a detailed survey of various yield enhancement techniques 
and illustrate their use by describing the design of several
representative defect-tolerant VLSI circuits.

<H2> Abstract</H2>
The yield of a VLSI chip depends, among other factors, on the 
sensitivity of the chip to defects occurring during the fabrication
process.
To predict this sensitivity, one usually needs to compute the so-called
<i>critical area</i> which reflects how many and how large
the defects must be in order to result in a circuit failure.
The main computational problem in yield estimation is to calculate
the critical area efficiently for complicated, irregular layouts.
A novel approach is suggested for this problem that results in
an algorithm that will solve it efficiently.
This paper provides an interactive accurate and fast method for the
rapid evaluation of critical area as a design tool with good visual
feedback to allow layout improvement for higher yield.
The algorithm is compared to other yield-prediction methods,
which use either the Monte-Carlo approach (VLASIC) or a deterministic
approach (SCA), and is shown to be faster.
It also has the advantage that it can graphically show a
detailed `defect sensitivity map' that can assist a chip designer
in improving the yield of his/her layout.

<H2> Abstract</H2>
This paper summarizes a practical experiment in designing a defect
tolerant microprocessor and presents the underlying principles.
Unlike memory integrated circuits, microprocessors have an irregular 
structure which complicates both
the task of incorporating redundancy for 
defect tolerance in the design and the task of analyzing the resulting
yield increase. The main goal of this paper is to present the detailed
yield analysis of a defect tolerant microprocessor with an
irregular structure which has been successfully fabricated.

The approaches employed for achieving the goal of yield enhancement in 
the data path and the control part of the microprocessor are 
described first. Then, the yield enhancement due to the incorporated 
redundancy is analyzed. Finally, some practical and theoretical 
conclusions are drawn.

<H2> Abstract</H2>
The primary goal of fault-tolerant designs of very large
integrated circuits is yield enhancement.  Such designs were first
employed in memory chips and recently extended to random logic VLSI
circuits and wafer scale circuits.
The primary motivation for introducing fault tolerance in VLSI circuits
is yield enhancement, i.e., increasing the percentage of fault-free
chips.  The active area of monolithic VLSI chips has 
always been limited by random fabrication defects, which appear 
impossible to eliminate in even the best manufacturing processes.  
The larger the circuit, the more likely it is to contain such a defect 
and fail to operate correctly.  Thus, 
the defect density (number of defects per unit chip area) in any 
fabrication line limits the size of the largest defect-free chip size
that can be produced with commercially viable yields.
Larger circuits must be designed with a fault tolerance capability to
overcome fabrication defects, to avoid unreasonable cost.

<H2> The Effect of Scaling on the Yield of VLSI Circuits</H2>

<H2> Abstract</H2>
As IC technology advances, the minimum feature size of VLSI circuitry
continues to decrease.
The smaller feature size of transistors has the potential of
speeding up the circuits and increasing the yield of the
manufactured chips.  The latter is due to the smaller silicon area
of the chip resulting in a lower average number of defects per chip.
Manufacturers of existing VLSI chips also attempt to take advantage 
of the possible reduction in feature size by scaling
(shrinking) the existing designs of their VLSI chips.

The effect of scaling the physical dimensions of VLSI circuits on
their electrical characteristics (and consequently on their speed
of operation) has already been studied.
The effect of scaling on the yield has been studied until now only 
for special cases like interconnection buses.
The subject of this paper is the effect of scaling on the yield of
more general VLSI circuits.

<H2> Abstract</H2>
The recent increases in the size of memory ICs have made designers
realize that there exists a need for new defect-tolerance techniques,
since the traditional methods are no longer effective.
One such new technique, the <i>Flexible Multi-Macro</i> (FMM) technique,
has recently been suggested and implemented in a 1 Gb DRAM circuit.
In this paper we present a yield analysis of the FMM design and compare 
its yield to that of the most common defect-tolerance technique of
adding spare rows and columns to the memory array.

Several 64-bit adders have been designed and their expected yield has
been estimated. Our results show that the yield of VLSI adders can be
improved by modifying the layout of the original design and/or by
choosing a different layout and circuit structure. In certain
situations, these approaches can improve the yield by 10% to 17%.
