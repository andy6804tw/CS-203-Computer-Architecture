<H1> Best Paper Award</H1>
The IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing Best Paper
Award is presented to the authors of that paper considered by the
Transactions' Editorial Staff and reviewers to be the outstanding
paper published during the year. The award is based on the
accuracy, originality, and importance of the technical concept, as
well as the quality and readability of the manuscript.
The Best Paper Award is also based on the immediate or potential
impact that this work will have on the overall semiconductor
manufacturing industry.
<p>
The IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing Best Paper Award,
presented at the annual Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing
Conference and workshop, recognizes the on-going partnership of
this conference and IEEE.
<p>
The Editorial Staff is pleased to announce that the paper entitled
"Layout Synthesis Techniques for Yield Enhancement," by V.K.R.
Chiluvuri and I. Koren, has been recognized as the best paper
published in the 1995 Transactions. This paper,
which appeared in the May issue, has been chosen because it
presents a novel method to apply yield enhancement techniques at a
high level of design abstraction. The techniques discussed enable
the IC to be desensitized to point defect related yield loss
without increasing the die area during the layout synthesis phase
of the IC development. The techniques described in this paper have
been used in a commercially available CAD framework.
