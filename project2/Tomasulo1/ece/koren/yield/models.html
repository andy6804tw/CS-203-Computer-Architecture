<H2> Abstract</H2>
Defect maps of 57 wafers containing large area VLSI ICs were
analyzed in order to find a good match between the empirical
distribution of defects and a theoretical model. 
Our main result is that the commonly employed models, most notably,
the large area clustering negative binomial distribution, do not
provide a sufficiently good match for these large area ICs.
Only the recently proposed medium size clustering model is close
enough to the empirical distribution. 
An even better match can be obtained either by combining two 
theoretical distributions or by a ``censoring" procedure
in which the worst chips are ignored.
Another goal of the study was to find out whether certain portions
of either the chip or the wafer had more defects than the others.

<H2> Abstract</H2>
It has been recently recognized that the yield of fault-tolerant
VLSI circuits depends on the size of the fault clusters.
Consequently, models for yield analysis have been proposed for 
``large-area clustering'' and ``small-area clustering,'' based
on the two-parameter negative-binomial distribution.
We propose the addition of a new parameter, the block size, to the
two existing parameters of the fault distribution. The new
parameter allows us to unify the existing models and at the same
time add a whole range of ``medium-size clustering'' models.
Thus, we increase the flexibility in choosing the appropriate yield
model. We present methods for estimating the newly defined block
size and validate our approach through simulation and empirical
data.

<H2> Abstract</H2>
The dependence of the yield of defect tolerant VLSI circuits on the
size of defect clusters (relative to the chip size) has been
recently recognized. Consequently, models for yield analysis have
been proposed for ``large area clustering" and ``small area clustering".
By adding a new parameter, the block size, to the existing parameters of
the defect distribution 
we unify the analysis of the existing models and at the same time
add a whole range of ``medium size clustering" models, thus
increasing the flexibility in choosing the appropriate yield model.
We illustrate our approach through several numerical examples and 
propose methods for estimating the newly defined block size.
